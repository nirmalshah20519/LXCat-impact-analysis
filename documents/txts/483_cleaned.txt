Abstract

This experimental and numerical study is focused on the formation of
fully ionized plasmas in ambient air by nanosecond pulsed discharges,
namely the thermal spark. The first contribution of this article is the
experimental characterization of the electron number density during the
pulse. An increase of the electron number density up to 1019 cm-3 was
measured with sub-nanosecond resolution via three techniques based on
optical emission spectroscopy (OES): Stark broadening of Hα Stark
broadening of N+/O+, and the continuum emission of electrons. The
discharge diameter is measured with sub-nanosecond resolution using
calibrated OES of the N+ and O+ lines. All measurements indicate a
transition to a micrometric-size filament of fully ionized plasma in
approximately 0.5 ns. The second main contribution of this work is the
development of a 0-D kinetic mechanism to explain this observation. The
mechanism includes 100 reactions, 12 species, and 12 excited electronic
states. Particular attention is paid to modeling the N2, N2+, N, and O
electronic state kinetics using the electronic states as additional
pseudo-species. Our results show that including the electron-impact
ionization of the excited electronic states of N and O, in addition to
those of N2, is necessary to explain the experimental results,
emphasizing the key role of excited state kinetics in the thermal spark
formation.

1. Introduction

In a book that has become a reference in plasma physics, Raizer
classified the different types of plasma that can be produced in
laboratories and nature. Among the various plasma sources in this
ranking, “the spark discharge stands out sharply” [1]. In laboratories,
a discharge is typically generated between two electrodes when an
electric field above the breakdown threshold is applied. If the current
is sustained for a time sufficiently long, “the spark current produces a
cathode spot and the spark transforms into [a continuous] arc” [1]. This
transition between the transient spark phase (or “breakdown”) and the
arc phase was experimentally observed in millisecond discharges employed
in the automotive industry for the ignition of combustible mixtures [2].
While the spark phase is typically a non-equilibrium plasma, the arc is
at local thermal and chemical equilibrium. For decades, the short
duration of nanosecond discharges

has been leveraged to generate non-equilibrium plasmas before their
transitions to the arc at thermal equilibrium [3]. These non-equilibrium
plasmas can be sustained at a quasi-steady state by repeating the
nanosecond discharge at kHz frequencies. Nanosecond repetitively pulsed
(NRP) discharges feature rich non-thermal chemistry and therefore
present a broad interest in several fields of engineering [4], such as
plasma-assisted combustion [5,6] and plasma medicine [7]. They have been
studied in various gas mixtures with the electrodes facing open gaps
[8–16] or separated by dielectric barriers [17–19].

In air, Pai et al. distinguished three regimes of NRP discharges: (i)
NRP-corona, (ii) NRP-glow, and (iii) NRP-spark [9]. A summary of the
typical characteristics of these discharges is provided in Table 1.
Typical emission spectra of these NRP-corona, glow, and spark discharges
in air are dominated by and emissions. The emission of O atoms and is
also present in the glow and spark regimes. Criteria for the corona-glow
and glow-spark transitions were proposed in [9]. The corona and glow
discharges are characterized by high voltages, low conduction currents
(< 1 A), and low deposited energies (less than 100 J per pulse) [9].
These two non-equilibrium discharges produce moderate gas heating (less
than 200 K) and relatively low electron number densities (less than cm-3
in air at atmospheric pressure) [10]. Corona discharges are confined
near the electrodes, whereas the glow and the spark fill the entire
interelectrode space. The NRP-spark is characterized by a much higher
current (> tens of A) and higher energy deposition (> 1 mJ per mm per
pulse) [9,11,20]. The gas temperature in the nanosecond spark was found
to increase by thousands of kelvins in a few tens of nanoseconds due to
the ultrafast heating mechanism [11,21–24]. Although the electron number
density reaches - cm-3 in the nanosecond non-thermal spark [21], the
plasma does not reach equilibrium.

Table 1 Typical parameters of NRP corona, glow [10], spark [11,21], and
thermal spark [25,26] [27] discharges in air near ambient pressure. The
deposited electrical energy is estimated for discharge dimensions of
approximately 1 mm.

However, recent observations of nanosecond discharges do not fit in the
three regimes mentioned above. In a study of single microsecond pulses
in ambient air, Lo et al. [28] observed a complete ionization of the gas
with high electron number densities that do not correspond to any of the
discharge regimes described above. The transition from the partially to
fully ionized plasma, called “streamer-to-arc” was shorter than 5 ns and
accompanied by a dramatic temperature rise, from 1,200 K to 36,000 K, in
less than 5 ns. Observations of fully ionized plasmas under nanosecond
discharges were also reported in water vapor [29,30] and air [31,32].
Observations of N+ emission for nanosecond discharges in pin-to-pin
configuration were also presented in [33,34]. These authors showed that
the “constriction” was accompanied by the emission of “spots” at the
electrodes. In a series of papers, Parkevich et al. used laser
interferometry and low astigmatism lenses to show that the fully ionized
discharge propagates in the form of more than ten fully ionized
filaments, 10-50 µm in diameter, whereas the discharge looks homogeneous
if conventional lenses are used [35–38]. These publications in the 2010s
extended the earlier studies performed decades ago for longer discharge
durations. In 1977, Stritzke et al. [39] mapped the electron temperature
during and after the full ionization using lines of N+, N++, N+++, and
N++++. For the conditions of Stritzke et al., the emission of N+
appeared at electron number densities above 1016 cm-3, and the electron
temperature reached 50,000 K. Similar ionization fractions were also
measured in 1977 by Albrecht et al. [40] using Stark broadening. In the
literature on transient fully ionized plasmas, several denominations
were employed by different authors. We recently called this regime “the
thermal spark” to distinguish it from the previously observed corona,
glow, and non-thermal spark regimes

characterized by Pai et al. [9]. This naming emphasizes the thermal
equilibrium state of the plasma (thermal) but also employs the
denomination of Raizer for transient discharges (spark) [1].

A counterpart of the thermal spark was concomitantly observed in Surface
Dielectric Barrier Discharge (SDBD). Houpt and Leonov [41] showed that
the “contraction” of the channel of a 50-μs SDBD in ambient air is
associated with the appearance of a continuum spectrum and lines of N+ ,
N, O, and Hα. Using a 20-ns SDBD, Shcherbanev et al. [42] observed a
transition from molecular emission to a continuum-dominated spectrum
accompanied by an increased Stark broadening of Hα (20-30 nm) and O777nm
(5 nm) lines. They named it the “streamer-to-filament” transition
[43,44]. The same group measured electron number densities ne = 1018 –
1019 cm-3 in similar configurations and carefully documented the
propagation of the surface fully ionized filaments [42]. More recently,
they measured surface filament diameters of 10 µm [45]. These values are
comparable to those of Parkevich et al. [35–38,46] observed in
pin-to-pin configuration and mentioned earlier. This flagrant similarity
in temperature, composition, and spatiotemporal scales suggests that
SDBD filaments and thermal sparks share similar kinetics.

It should be noted that the typical timescales of the transition to full
ionization are sub-nanosecond, which, added to the micrometric
dimensions, make the thermal sparks very challenging to characterize.
Nevertheless, our group recently performed sub-nanosecond imaging and
optical emission spectroscopy [25] and showed that thermal sparks are
generated in five steps: (i) Formation of a partially ionized plasma
across the inter-electrodes gap; (ii) Formation of a fully ionized
filament at the cathode in less than 0.5 ns. The filament is at thermal
equilibrium; (iii) Formation of a similar filament at the anode, delayed
compared to the cathode filament; (iv) Propagation of these two fully
ionized filaments toward each other; and (v) Merging of the filaments to
form the thermal spark. This five-step process matched1 the observation
also reported in [47, p.82]. After the energy deposition ends, the fast
electron number density decay was proven to be due to an isentropic
expansion during which the plasma remains at equilibrium [25,28,32].
Although the thermal spark formation was experimentally characterized,
the reasons behind the abrupt formation of the fully ionized filaments
remained unclear, especially the short (0.5 ns) transition from a
partially to a fully ionized plasma. To answer these questions,
numerical simulations of the thermal spark had to be performed.

Kinetic mechanisms for non-equilibrium discharges already exist in the
literature [23,48–52], typically based on the work of Kossyi et al. [53]
or Capitelli et al. [54]. For the streamer-to-filament transition (in
SDBD), Shcherbanev et al. [42] performed kinetic simulations (230 Td in
N2 at 6 bar) to explain the fast increase of ne up to values of about
1019 cm-3 . The authors reported in their simulation an increase of the
ionization degree by three orders of magnitude in 0.25 ns, due mainly to
the dissociation and ionization of N2(B) and N2(C). However, this
mechanism cannot produce ionization fractions above 10%. Therefore, a
key mechanism is missing to explain the formation of a fully (100%)
ionized plasma in a fraction of a nanosecond. To address this issue, we
proposed in Ref. [26] to include the excitation and ionization of the N
and O electronic states by electron impact. With this additional set of
reactions, the full ionization in air was obtained. However,
experimental confirmation of the model’s predictions was still needed.

This paper investigates the formation of thermal sparks generated in air
by NRP discharges in a pin-to-pin configuration. First, in Section 2,
the experimental setup is described. In Section 3, the temporal
evolution of the electron number density and the discharge diameter are
measured. In Section 4, a kinetic mechanism to explain the phenomenon of
full ionization by nanosecond pulses is proposed. Finally, in Section 5,
the results of these simulations are validated by comparison with the
measurements.

1 However, some experimental results demonstrated that the filaments
formation (step 2. and 3.) were synchronized within 0.5 ns [46,116]. As
underlined by [36,46,116], the electrode curvature and surface quality
plays a role in the filament formation. The presence of a strong ionic
current near the electrode could foster beneficial conditions, such as
surface topology or temperature, that could lead to earlier filament
formation.

2. Experimental setup

The experimental setup, presented in Figure 1, is extensively described
in our previous study [25]. Briefly, a nanosecond discharge is generated
(FID FPG 30-100MC4K) at 1 kHz between two pin electrodes separated by
1.2 mm. The experiments are performed in ambient air at 0.1 MPa
(humidity below saturation) and within 30 minutes before any erosion of
the cathode is noticeable. In specific experiments, we use a mixture of
ambient air and H2 (3.7%) to measure the electron number density from
the Hα Stark broadening). The discharge is placed at the focal point of
an off-axis parabolic mirror (f = 10 cm), as shown in Figure 1. The
collimated light from the plasma is then refocused by a second parabolic
mirror (f = 20 cm) onto the monochromator (Acton 500i) entrance slit.
The monochromator is equipped with two gratings of 300 and 1800 gr·mm-1
, both blazed at 500 nm. An ICCD camera (Pi-MAX4) coupled to the
monochromator is used to record the spectra with a gate of 450 ps. The
pixel size of the ICCD is 13 μm. A HeNe laser (Thorlabs) is used to
determine the instrumental broadening of the optical system. Absolute
intensity calibration of the optical system is performed using an
integration lamp (OL455, Gooch and Housego).

Figure 1 Experimental setup (same as in previous work [25] except for a
change in the length of the coaxial cables).

The discharge is generated by a positive 10-ns pulse (sent to the anode)
and a negative 10-ns pulse (sent to the cathode). Hence, the energy
deposition is monitored by two high-voltage probes (LeCroy PPE20kV) and
two current transformers (Pearson 6585) connected to an oscilloscope
(Lecroy HDO 6104). The measured voltage and current are represented in
Figure 2. The voltage and current measurements are performed in the
coaxial circuit, 4 meters away from the electrodes. Thus, the incident
10-ns voltage pulse can be separated from the reflected pulse arising
due to impedance mismatch.

Figure 2 Measured voltage and current on a) the anode and b) the cathode
sides. The amplitude difference between the incident pulses at the anode
and the cathode is only due to a technical peculiarity of the pulser.

The instantaneous power is the product of the voltage, U, and current,
I. The total energy, E, is the time integration of the power in Eq. 1,
where the indices ‘cat’ and ‘an’ denote the cathode and the anode,
respectively.

Eq. 1

In Figure 2, t = 0 ns is defined as the moment the nanosecond pulse
reaches the electrode, accounting for the 15-ns delay between the
measurement of the voltage rise and its actual arrival at the electrode.
As shown in Figure 3, the incident anode and cathode pulses carry 3.9 mJ
to the interelectrode gap. Due to an impedance mismatch between the
coaxial cable and the plasma, a part of the energy (1.5 mJ) is reflected
towards the generator, defined as the upstream direction. Another
impedance mismatch on the generator (switched OFF for t > 10 ns) leads
to a new reflection. Thus, a pulse travels in the downstream direction
and is detected at t = 75 ns. The second pulse carries mJ and deposits
mJ in the interelectrode gap. For the same reasons, a pulse is detected
at t = 150 ns and deposits another 0.25 mJ. This sequential energy
deposition was already observed in previous work [20,25,55] and could
explain the “ringing” observed in Ref. [56]. In the comparison of
experiments and simulations in Section 5, we restrict the study of the
electron number density increase for t < 20 ns, avoiding the
complications due to secondary pulses. The instantaneous applied
electric field and current, reconstructed from the sum of the incident
and reflected pulses at both electrodes, are shown later in Figure 9.

Figure 3 Total transmitted energy according to Eq. 1. Approximately 2.5,
0.25, and 0.25 mJ are deposited in the , , and pulses, respectively.

Table 2 Summary of the experimental parameters of this work, compared to
those of our previous study [25].

The experimental parameters used in the present study are summarized in
Table 2. The experimental parameters of our previous work, performed in
a single pulse regime, are also compared.

3. Experimental results

In Section 3.a, the measurements of the electron number density using
the Stark broadening of , at nm, and , at nm, are described. Each line
covers a different range of ionization degrees and their overlap serves
as a validation of our procedure. In Section 3.b, the discharge radius
is measured using the calibrated Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) of
and recorded near nm. In Section 3.c, the electron number density is
measured via the electron continuum emission. The measurements are
spatially resolved along the interelectrode gap. In Section 3.d, we
compare the results obtained with the different methods in the region
near the cathode, which is the location where the transition to a fully
ionized plasma is the fastest.

a. Stark broadening of Ha

A review of line broadening for several atoms and ions, including , ,
and , was presented in our previous work [25]. In this Section, the
primary sources of broadening of the transition are calculated, showing
that Stark broadening is the dominant mechanism. For the lines, the
methods employed in this study are the same as in [25] and are not
described here.

The electron number density can be accurately measured using the Stark
broadening of the line at 656 nm. The Half-Width at Half Maximum (HWHM)
of results from several broadening mechanisms: Doppler, resonant,
natural, Van der Waals, Stark, and instrumental [25,57,58]. In the
following, we estimate the non-Stark contributions to the HWHM of the
line and show that they are negligible. The broadening formulas used in
the present work were initially developed by Griem [57] and simplified
for in [58]. The work of Ref. [58] was recently improved and extended to
, , O, N, , and [25]. In the following, the gas transformation is
assumed to be isochoric with an initial ambient number density of cm-3.
The gas temperature varies from 300 K (initial condition) to K (fully
ionized plasma), which induces moderate changes in the Doppler HWHM. The
number density of atomic hydrogen is estimated to be below cm-3,
resulting in negligible resonant broadening (HWHM < 1 pm). Natural
broadening is also negligible. Van der Waals broadening results from the
perturbation of the transition by non-hydrogenic particles ( , , , , and
). The sum of all the contributions is given in Eq. 2, where is the
total gas density, and are calculated in Ref. [25].

Eq. 2

The sum in Eq. 2 can be simplified using defined in Eq. 3.

Eq. 3

In Table 3, the value of is calculated in air. During the thermal spark
formation, the gas composition varies from N2:O2 at 300 K, to N:O at
20,000 K, and finally N+:O+:e- at 40,000 K. For these compositions, the
Van der Waals HWHM varies from 34 to 267 pm. For comparison, when the
plasma is partially ionized at 20,000 K, a Stark HWHM of 34 pm
corresponds to cm-3, which is well below our sensitivity limit. When the
gas is fully ionized and T = 40,000 K, a Stark broadening of 34 pm would
correspond to an electron number density of cm-3, which is three orders
of magnitude lower than the measured electron number density. The Van
der Waals broadening is therefore negligible compared to the Stark
broadening.

Table 3 Estimated coefficient and Van der Waals broadening HWHM of the
Ha line in ambient air at 300 K, dissociated air at 20,000 K, and fully
ionized air at 40,000 K.

The instrumental broadening for a given spectrometer focal length mainly
depends on the spectrometer slit opening and its grating. We used two
gratings in this study to follow the variations of the HWHM from 0.1 nm
to 20 nm. The corresponding instrumental HWHM is given in Table 4. A
typical example of the line fit is shown in Figure 4. The width
uncertainty is about , which leads to a 30% uncertainty on the measured
with this technique.

Figure 4 Fit of the line at t = 2.25 ns (1800-gr/mm grating).

The Stark broadening HWHM can be calculated2 with Eq. 4 [59,60].

Eq. 4

In this work, Stark broadening measurements are performed during the
high-voltage pulse. In Ref. [61], it was shown that the applied electric
field could have an impact on the Stark broadening. In that case, the
width of the spectral line would be related to the current density
instead of the electron number density. In Ref. [61], expressions are
derived for the Stark broadening of and generated by the sum of two
fields:

- A microscopic field, arising from the presence of ions and electrons
  in plasma. This is the typical Stark broadening effect.
- A macroscopic field applied in one direction during the experiment.
  This field can interfere with the Stark broadening.

According to Bastien & Marode [61], the Stark broadening is mainly due
to the shifting of intense external lines caused by the static ions’
microfield. Thus, the addition of an external field has an impact on the
Stark broadening. On the other hand, Bastien & Marode showed that the
addition of an external field has a weak impact on the lineshape. For
instance, at cm-3 and K, the Stark HWHM of remains independent of the
applied field up to at least 12 kV·mm-1 (four times the Holtsmark field,
see Table 1 of [61]). In our experiments, the maximum applied field is
6.7 kV·mm-1 when cm-3. Therefore, the applied field does not influence
our Stark broadening measurements of during the pulse.

To summarize, the Doppler, resonant, and Van der Waals HWHM are
negligible or smaller than the Stark broadening width, see Table 4.
Their contribution is however included in the post-processing of the OES
spectra.

based on the formula given in Ref. [25]. See also Table 3 for the
estimation of the Van der Waals HWHM.

&lt;sup>2 The relation given initially by Gigosos et al. [59] must be
corrected by a factor 2 as noted by Konjević et al. [60].

b. Discharge radius measurement using N+ and O+ path-integrated number density

In this subsection, the results of the intensity-calibrated OES near 500
nm are presented and employed to measure the discharge optical diameter.
In the work of Shcherbanev et al. [42], it was reported that the
emission of filamentary SDBD was the sum of two concentric channels. In
their case, the intense N+ and continuum spectral features were emitted
from the central core, whereas a weaker N2 emission originated from the
outer shell. Shcherbanev et al. reported a central core Full Width at
Half Maximum (FWHM) of 18 ± 2 µm. In a configuration similar to ours,
Orrière measured the FWHM of a thermal spark [47]. He found an FWHM of
50 µm for a 6-kV discharge of 20 ns applied across a 1-mm gap between
the electrodes3 . However, no spectral filter was used; therefore, the
measurement of Orrière et al. is an upper bound of their thermal spark
diameter. In a 25-kV discharge of 40 ns at ambient conditions, Parkevich
et al. [36] used interferometry to show that their discharge was
composed of several fully ionized filaments, 10 – 50 μm in diameter. A
recent study by Parkevitch and Khirianova [62] suggests that the
formation of several smaller propagating filaments (instead of a single
one) occurs above a current threshold of 40 – 100 A. Finally, Lo et al.
clearly observed a constriction of the discharge channel during the
transition to the thermal spark in a microsecond pulsed discharge in air
[28].

In the present study, the plasma column diameter is estimated by
focusing the discharge image on the CCD with a magnification factor of 2
and employing a 10-nm bandpass filter centered at 480 nm (Hard Coated OD
4.0 10-nm Bandpass Filter, Edmund Optics). An accurate measurement is
challenging with our present setup because of the shotto-shot spatial
displacement of the discharge (~10 µm) and because the column width is
comparable with the pixel width, which could result in pixel bleeding.
Nevertheless, the CCD images provide a first-order estimate of the
plasma diameter of the order or less than the pixel resolution, i.e. Δl
= 15 µm. This value is similar to the measurements of Shcherbanev et
al., Orrière, and Parkevich et al.

At T ~ 30,000 K, the plasma reaches complete ionization and hence
thermal and chemical equilibrium [25]. At these temperatures, after an
isochoric transformation, the plasma is mainly composed of electrons
(50%), and ions N+ (40%) and O+ (10%) [63]. The electron number density
was determined as described in Section 3.a. Thus, because the plasma is
neutral, the number density of the ions (N+ and O+ ) is known and equal
to ne. The spectral emissivity of a uniform emission spectrum due to a
given transition at λ [nm] is a function of the upper state ion number
density, [cm-3 ], the photon energy (hc/λ), the transition upper state
energy and degeneracy, [J] and , the temperature, T [K], the partition
function, (), the transition Einstein coefficient, [s-1 ], the plasma
optical diameter Δ [m-1 ], the absorption coefficient k [m-1 ], and the
broadening function, [nm-1 ], see Eq. 5 [64].

Eq. 5

Thus, the knowledge of the calibrated intensity spectrum of a given line
of N+ or O+ and the electron density can provide a direct measurement of
the discharge diameter, Δ.

3 For a 2-kV pulse across 200-µm gap, Orriere measured a FWHM of 40 µm.

Figure 5 Fit of the and emission near the cathode at t = 9.75 ns. The
continuum emission is approximated by a linear function (in blue) and
the and emission is calculated by Specair (in red). The and lines are
calculated, accounting for self-absorption.

A typical spectrum is shown in Figure 5. The spectrum is fitted using an
in-house extension of Specair [58,65] and accounting for
self-absorption. For O+ and N+ lines, the Stark line broadening
dominates and the lineshape fit provides another measurement of . The
uncertainty on the Stark broadening fitting (and determination) is below
20%. The continuum radiation (assumed to be linear) is subtracted and
studied in Section 3.c. All electronic states of the ions are assumed to
follow a Boltzmann distribution at . The measured electronic temperature
( ) corresponds to values usually reported in the thermal spark
literature [25,28,32]. The accuracy of the measurements is 5%, implying
that the path-integrated radiance is at best 30% accurate.

Because the plasma is globally neutral, we have , where is taken from
the N+ Stark broadening. The inferred plasma diameter evolution using
this assumption and Eq. 5 is shown in Figure 6. This method
theoretically offers a micrometer resolution and allows tracking the
growth of the filament with sub-nanosecond resolution during its
development. Initially, the thermal spark diameter is only about 1 m,
then grows to an asymptotic value of about 10 m after about 20 ns. These
filament diameters (about 10 m at the end of the discharge pulse) are
consistent with those reported for SDBD, i.e. 18 m, during the
transition to a fully ionized plasma [42]. Also, the estimate based on
CCD imaging (15 m) is within the error bars. This time-resolved optical
diameter is used in the next section to process the electron continuum
measurements.

We now discuss the potential effects arising due to such small diameters
where the magnetic pressure could play a role. Assuming an isochoric
heating from 300 to 30,000 K, complete dissociation and ionization, then
the kinetic pressure is atm. The magnetic pressure, , can be estimated
from Eq. 6, where H·m-1 is the magnetic permeability and B the
tangential magnetic field.

Eq. 6

The tangential magnetic field on the filament boundary can be
approximated by the magnetic field generated by an infinitely thin
straight wire. Using , where I is the electrical current, and is the
filament radius, the magnetic pressure is given by Eq. 7 [42].

Eq. 7

Using typical values corresponding to the present case, I = 200 A and
µm, we obtain atm ~ . Thus, a z-pinch effect is likely to reduce the
discharge diameter and prevent its expansion until the end of the
current pulse. For t > 7 ns, the current decreases (see later in Figure
9), which decreases the magnetic pressure and allows the diameter to
increase.

No explanation is currently provided in the literature for the origin of
micrometer filaments. The theory of Raizer [1] on leader propagation
does not explain this phenomenon. As increases near the cathode, the
cathode sheath size and the electron collision cross-section decrease.
As a consequence, the cathode sheath becomes collisionless and runaway
electrons can be formed [66–68]. These highly energetic electrons enter
the partially ionized zone and could leave a trail of seed electrons
behind, which could trigger the transition to a fully ionized region.
This potential explanation needs validation and could be simulated in
air by combining the approach of Levko and Raja [66,67] with the kinetic
mechanism presented in the next section.

line radiation, and comparison with the diameter estimated using CCD
imaging (dashed blue line).

c. Continuum radiation of electrons

This Section describes another method for measuring the electron number
density, this time using the electron continuum emission. As shown in
several works, continuum radiation can be significant in laser-induced
plasmas [69], DBD discharges [42], or pin-to-pin nanosecond discharges
[70]. Recently, laser absorption by the electron continuum was employed
to measure the ionization degree of a fully ionized plasma [71].

The electron continuum emission results from the free-free radiation
(also called Bremsstrahlung) and the free-bound radiation (also called
recombination continuum). The continuum emission coefficient is given in
Eq. 8, where and are the electron and ion number densities, the ion
charge, the electron temperature, the free-bound Gaunt factor, and G the
free-free Gaunt factor [72].

Eq. 8

If several types of ions are present in the mixture, the total continuum
radiation will be a sum over , i being the ion species. In the present
case, we consider that is the dominant ion and . If the plasma is mainly
composed of

neutral atoms, another formulation must be used [73,74]. The C8 constant
can be determined with Eq. 9, where e is the electron charge, kb the
Boltzmann constant, c the speed of light, and me the electron mass.

Eq. 9

The dimensionless variable u is defined in Eq. 10, where h is the Planck
constant, kb the Boltzmann constant, c the speed of light and λ the
wavelength.

Eq. 10

The free-free Gaunt factor of N+ (and O+ ) at λ = 500 nm varies from G =
1.08 to G = 1.1 for T in the range 32,000 – 42,000 K, interpolating4 the
results of [75]. The free-bound Gaunt factor should be averaged on the
atom’s final states (i.e. after the electron has recombined with the
ion). The free-bound Gaunt factor at λ = 500 nm (= 0.18 Ry) ranges
between ξ = 0.8 and ξ = 1.2 depending on the final bound state (see the
values calculated for any ions in Table 1 of Ref. [76]). Here we assume
ξ = 1 and G = 1.09. These coefficients are considered to be accurate5
within 10%. Assuming ne = ni, we obtain ne [m-3 ] as a function of λ
[nm], the volumetric emission coefficient [W·m-3 ·sr-1 ·nm-1 ], and Te
[K], see [72]:

Eq. 11

Solving the radiative transport equation [64], the spectral emissivity
is related to the continuum intensity Ic [W·m-2 ·sr-1 ·nm-1 ], the
absorption coefficient k [m-1 ], and the plasma width Δl [m] as follows:

Eq. 12

The absorption coefficient, k, is the sum of the continuum and
bound-bound absorption, kbb and kc, respectively. In a worst-case
scenario, we assume that the absorption coefficient across the entire
spectrum is equal to the bound-bound contribution, i.e. k ~ kbb. For a
plasma diameter of 15 µm and ne = nN+ = 1019 cm-3 , we calculated with
Specair that Δ < 0.5 between 460 and 530 nm. Based on this estimation,
the plasma is optically thin, i.e. ≈ Δ. This approximation leads to an
overestimation of by 40% at most, which is acceptable, as shown in the
next paragraph. Finally, Eq. 11 can be further simplified as given by
Eq. 13, where ne [m-3 ]is a function of Δl [m] the plasma width, Ic
[W·m-2 ·sr-1 ·nm-1 ] the continuum intensity, Te [K] the electron
temperature, and λ [nm] the wavelength of observation.

Eq. 13

Thanks to the power 1/2 on the right-hand side of Eq. 13, the impact on
the electron number density of the uncertainty on the measured intensity
Ic is halved. The uncertainty on Te is about 10%. The free-free and
free-bound coefficients vary slowly with Te and, in this case, are known
within ±10%. The intensity calibration of the absolute spectrum is
accurate within about ±20%. Considering the thin plasma assumption, the
maximum uncertainty on is +20% and -60%. The plasma thickness, Δ, is
estimated to be accurate within 30%. Therefore, after propagation of the
uncertainties through quadrature summation, the ne deduced from the
continuum emission is found to be accurate within -70% and +40%.

4 We used the ChiantiPy Python package [118,119] at
https://github.com/chianti-atomic/ChiantiPy.

5 If needed, a more precise value could be obtained using the summation
performed by ChiantiPy with the values of [120]. As described later, the
dominant uncertainty comes from on the plasma thickness and the Gaunt
factors uncertainty is unimportant.

d. Comparison of the electron density measurements

Electron number densities measured with the three techniques described
above are compared in Figure 7. The line measurements are performed
using two gratings, with an overlap between the acquisitions to ensure
data reproducibility. From t = 1.25 ns to t = 8 ns, increases from to
cm-3. The steep increase of the electron number density (over a decade)
at t = 4 ns corresponds to the filament formation. For t = 4 - 6 ns, the
continuum emission measurements (triangles) are slightly above those
obtained from Stark broadening (circles), whereas the Stark broadening
of (squares) slightly overestimates the Stark broadening measurements.
For t > 6 ns, the measurements from the three techniques are in
excellent agreement within the error bars. For t > 10 ns, the electron
density slowly decays to cm-3 at 23 ns due to the isentropic expansion
of the plasma channel [25,28]. These spectroscopic measurements are
compared to those performed by Orrière and Pai [32] in a nanosecond
discharge generated in a 200- m gap via the estimation of the gap
conductivity.

Figure 7 Evolution of the electron number density near the cathode
measured with Stark broadening of (red circles), Stark broadening of
(blue squares), and continuum radiation (purple triangles). We assumed
an optically thin plasma for continuum radiation interpretation only
(uncertainty propagated in the error bars). Our measurements are
compared to those of Orrière and Pai, see Figure 6 of [32].

4. Kinetic model of the thermal sparks

a. Introduction and numerical setup

In this Section, 0-D numerical simulations of plasma kinetics as a
function of the reduced electric field are performed using ZDPlasKin
[78]. We assume an isochoric transformation of the plasma, which is
typically the case for nanosecond discharges. The heat capacity ratio is
considered constant, , because it has a negligible effect on the speed
of ionization calculated in this work. The Electron Energy Distribution
Function (EEDF) is calculated by solving the Boltzmann equation
accounting for the mixture composition at each timestep with BOLSIG+
[79,80], using cross-sections of electron reactions taken mostly from
the LXCat database [81–85]. BOLSIG+ was not tested by its developers
above an ionization fraction of 1% and we did not modify the solver.
Nevertheless, it was shown in our previous work that, for an ionization
fraction above 1%, BOLSIG+ gives the same results as a kinetic
simulation assuming a Boltzmann EEDF, see Figure 11 of [26].

Several kinetic mechanisms for low-temperature plasmas are available in
the literature [50,53,54] and could have been used as a baseline. For
instance, the reaction set of Capitelli et al. was employed in our
previous work on the thermal spark [86]. However, these mechanisms
include hundreds of reactions, such as the formation of negative ions
and with , which are unnecessary to describe the thermal spark
formation. Instead, in this work, we employ a simplified 38-reaction set
from Laux et al. [8], supplemented with reactions taken from Popov [23]
and Shcherbanev et al. [42]. The reaction set of Laux et al. is adequate
because only the essential reactions and species driving the ionization
and recombination of plasma discharges in air are included. The selected
reactions taken from Popov include the ultrafast heating mechanism,
whereas those from Shcherbanev et al. [42] account for the dissociation
and ionization of excited states [87]. The originality of the present
mechanism is the addition of the excitation and ionization of and
excited states [88–90]. This new mechanism includes , , , , , , , , , ,

b. Detailed balance

The reverse rates are computed in these simulations via detailed balance
[91,92]. Let us define Reac. 1 involving four species: A, B, C, and D.

Reac. 1

If the forward rate coefficient of Reac. 1, , is known, then the reverse
rate coefficient, , can be computed using Eq. 14, where is the partition
function of species or pseudo-species X.

Eq. 14

If the collision partners are heavy particles, in Eq. 14. However, if
one electron is involved6, then . For instance, in the case of
ionization/recombination of atomic nitrogen N( S), see (R76), the
detailed balance is equivalent to the Saha formula (Eq. 15), where is
the electron mass, the Boltzmann constant, the electron temperature, h
the Planck constant, the degeneracy of the species or pseudo-species X,
I the ionization energy of N( S), and the ionization rate computed with
BOLSIG+.

&lt;sup>6 A particular treatment must be applied for three-body
reactions involving two heavies and one electron but does not apply to
this work [121].

Eq. 15

The first term in Eq. 15 is the inverse of the electron partition
function and the factor 1/2 accounts for the electron spin. The Saha
formula is exact if the EEDF is a Maxwellian (the use of requires to
have a Maxwellian EEDF).

c. List of reactions

This subsection provides the list of reactions and the motivation behind
their selection.

Table 5 The baseline kinetic mechanism used in this work is mainly taken
from [8]. The forward reaction coefficients are given, with their
dependence on either the gas temperature or the electron temperature.
The backward reaction rates are always calculated by detailed balance.
The star symbol (*) refers to the forward reaction rates identical to
those reported in Table 1 of [8].

Most of the reactions used by Laux et al. are taken from [93,97].
However, some reaction rate coefficients in [97] are calculated for Tgas
= 2000 K, which is unsuitable for the present work. Therefore, the
reaction rates calculated in [93] are replaced with calculations
performed using BOLSIG+ with the cross-sections specified in Table 5. In
the case of (R28), N+ + N2 ↔ N + N2 + , the rate constant is taken from
[93]. Note that some of the rate coefficients of charge exchange
reactions were rounded off in Table 1 of [8], but the exact values were
used in their simulation and ours.

The ionization of NO by electron impact was initially limited to (R25),
NO + e ↔ NO+ + 2e, in [8]. We added here the formation of O+ and N+ ,
(R26) and (R27) [96]. To our knowledge, the cross-section of NO
dissociation by electron impact is not available in the literature [96].
BOLSIG+ computes the rate of O2 dissociation by electron impact based on
the cross-sections7 provided in [94]. In this model, the N2 dissociation
and ionization by electron-impact are statespecific and more details are
given in Table 6. The heating due to NO+ , N2 + , and O2 + dissociative
recombination was found to have a minor impact on the temperature
increase (less than 50 K) [42].

For electron-heavy reactions, the rate constant is a function of the
electron temperature. For heavy-heavy reactions, the rate constant is a
function of the gas temperature. As discussed in Section 4.b this is
critical for associative ionization and dissociative recombination,
whose rate constants depend on Tg and Te, respectively. Finally, the
dissociative recombination of N2 + , (R21), is calculated with detailed
balance using Park’s rate of associative ionization. An alternative
method, not employed in this study, would have been to take the
cross-sections calculated by [87] or measured by [98].

Table 6 Additional set of reactions calculated with BOLSIG+.

7 Available in the LXCat Phelps database or the LXCat LISBON-IST
database

The cross-sections of the electronic excitation of to higher excited
states were measured by Cartwright et al. [102] and later renormalized
by Trajmar et al. [103]. Usually, these cross-sections are linked to the
LXCaT Phelps Database [104]. In our kinetic simulations, the
cross-section of electron-impact excitation of to is the sum of the
cross-sections to the levels taken from [99]. The states are lumped
together in the state, using the renormalized cross-sections of [102].
This is also the case for , which is the sum of states. The singlet
states are lumped together in the state. This grouping was initially
proposed in [53] and used in the kinetic mechanism8 of [51]. If further
refinements of these reactions were needed, one should focus on
distinguishing and because their dissociation cross-sections differ by
one order of magnitude.

The electronic excitation of by electron impact as well as the
transitions between the states by electron impact are taken from [87].
The ionization cross-sections of to , (R39), were estimated in [100]
based on the (normalized) measurement of Cartwright et al. and the
recommendations of Itikawa9. The ionization cross-sections of , (R41),
are taken from [87]. The dissociation cross-section of ground state,
(R42), is taken from [83,101], whereas the dissociation cross-sections
of the electronically excited states, (R43), are from [87]. In
electron-impact dissociation of any electronic state of , the fragments
are and and are neglected in this work because these species are not
dominant in these air plasmas10.

&lt;sup>9 We note however that these ionization cross-sections include
the dissociative ionization cross-sections. The impact of this
approximation is limited in the present case because ionization only
drives the partial ionization phase.

&lt;sup>10 If O2 excited states were to be included in a simulation, we
recommend using the cross-sections of the LXCat Phelps database, see
[51]. It was argued, however, that these states have a minor impact on
the chemistry [50]. For NO electronic excitation, note that
non-investigated discrepancies exist between the LXCat Itikawa database
and the LXCat Hayashi database.

Table 7 Electronic excitation and ionization of atomic species by
electron impact. The electron configuration and term are provided for
each state. Rate coefficients are rounded in the present table and
non-rounded values can be found in [90].

In the present work, we neglect11 the formation of excited electronic
states of N+ and O+ . The forward rate coefficients of electron-impact
ionization of the first three levels of N and O, (R76-R78) and (R84-86),
are calculated with BOLSIG+ using the ionization cross-sections obtained
by the B-spline R-matrix (BSR) approach [88,89]. For states above N(2D)
and up to N(4D0 ), the ionization rate coefficients calculated in [90]
are used. We will show in Section 5 that the reactions listed in Table 7
drive the final stage of thermal spark ionization. A summary of the
electronic levels of N2, N, and O modeled in the present mechanism is
given in Table 8.

11 We also neglected the three-body recombination with heavy colliders,
and therefore did not consider the following reaction, where A = N, O,
and M is any heavy collider.

Table 8 Electronic levels of N2, N, and O included in the present work.
The energy is given relative to the ground state [105,106] and g is the
level statistical weight.

Table 9 Supplementary reactions for the thermal spark transition.
Quenching reactions are taken from [23] and the ionization rate
coefficients of N+ and O+ are calculated in this work.

The quenching of N2 excited states is mainly taken from the work of
Popov [23], which is, to our knowledge, the most complete set of
reactions for the simulation of non-thermal nanosecond discharges. It
was shown in [23] that this set reproduces the ultrafast heating
observed in [21] and [16,110] with good accuracy. The quenching rate
coefficients of N2(A) given in Table 9 are slightly modified compared to
those of Popov because our model is not vibrational specific and does
not include O2 excited states. Therefore, it was assumed in (R88) that
O2 is not excited to the O2(b1Σg + ) state, which is different from the
(R2) reaction in [23].

Also, we discarded the (R3), (R4) and (R6) reactions of [23] because
they involve vibrationally excited molecules. The formation of NO by
N2(A) quenching, (R92), was neglected in the early work of Popov [111].
However, it was shown in [107] and later in [108,112] that the formation
of NO may have a higher impact than originally expected, which motivates
its addition to this mechanism.

For the conditions of Rusterholtz et al. [21], Popov showed that the
dissociative quenching of N2(A, B, C, a’) represent 63% of the total
oxygen dissociation [21,23]. Regarding the production of metastable
oxygen by N2(C) quenching, Popov used the branching ratio (46% / 52% /
2%) of metastable argon quenching by O2 [22,113]. The quenching of
metastable xenon, which has a similar energy as N2(B), does not produce
excited atomic oxygen [113]. Therefore, we assume that only O(3P) is
produced in N2(B) quenching. Note that Popov used a rate coefficient
constant with temperature for N2(C) quenching, although it was shown
that the rate varies with Tg 0.3 [21]. The product of N2(a’) quenching
is assumed to be O(3P) + O(1D) with a probability of one [23]. We
neglect as well the quenching of N(2D) and O(1S, 1D), reactions (R16) to
(R34) in [23], because these reactions induce vibrational excitation,
which is not included in the present mechanism. The quenching of N(2P)
by N2 was also neglected [114]. Using the rates from [50,53,54], we
found that the formation and recombination of N3 + induce negligible
variations to the formation of the thermal spark. Therefore, the N3 +
chemistry is not included in this work.

Finally, the formation of N++ and O++ by electron-impact of N+ and O+ is
included, (R99) and (R100). We integrated the cross-sections reported in
[115] with a Maxwellian EEDF and fitted the results with Arrhenius laws.
These Arrhenius rate coefficients fit the integrated results within 1%
in the 40,000 – 73,000 K range, see Table 10, which corresponds to the
range of temperature where these reactions have a significant impact.

Table 10 Deviation of the Arrhenius fits compared to rates calculated
from the cross-sections of N+ and O+ ionization by electron impact,
(R99) and (R100).

Note that this set of reactions is incomplete if one is interested in
the heating generated by non-thermal sparks. For that purpose, the
quenching of atomic metastable states may have to be included [49] along
with other species such as O- , O3, N3 + , and N4 + [50].

5. Comparison of the numerical kinetics with the experimental findings

As briefly mentioned before, we previously performed the simulation of
canonical discharges in air to explain the formation of a fully ionized
plasma in less than 10 ns [26]. In the present study, using a lighter
baseline mechanism allows for the inclusion of the reverse rates of the
reactions presented in Section 4.c. The chemical mechanism also gained
clarity. Another novelty compared to [26] is the inclusion of N++ and
O++ formation. Moreover, in the present work, an experimental voltage
waveform is employed to calculate the reduced electric field. The
applied voltage is calculated by summing the incident and reflected
waveforms. We will show in this section that the sub-nanosecond
transition to a fully ionized plasma is still driven by the formation of
the excited electronic states of N and O, noted N* and O* here, and
follows the same path as extensively described in [26]. The simulation
is computationally expensive when accounting for electron-electron
collisions in the EEDF calculation. The reader interested in conducting
these simulations at a reduced CPU cost could assume a Boltzmann EEDF
for an ionization fraction above 1%, which provides very similar results
– see Figure 11 of [26].

Table 11 Initial conditions and numerical parameters. The initial N2 and
O2 number densities correspond to air at 0.1 MPa (1 atm) and 300 K, and
the initial electron and N2 + number densities to typical ionization in
streamer discharges.

Initial gas state Numerical parameters

a. Comparison to electrical measurements

Figure 9 Experimental: Applied voltage (black) and current (green), both
reconstructed from the difference between the incident and reflected
pulses. Numerical: reduced field (red line), current density (purple),
and electron number density (in blue).

The simulation uses the initial conditions and numerical parameters
listed in Table 11. The time t = 0 ns is arbitrarily defined as the
first measurement of the electron number density by Stark broadening of
with enough signal-to-noise ratio. This instant corresponds
approximately to the top of the voltage ramp and the rise of the
current. The applied voltage on the 1.2-mm gap is represented in Figure
9 and was reconstructed from the anode and cathode voltage pulse shapes.
The reduced field, E/N, is calculated in the simulation at each time
step, assuming a Laplacian field between the electrodes and accounting
for the density change due to and dissociation. The reduced field is
arbitrarily reduced by 10% to account for the cathode fall (900 V at
maximal applied voltage). In BOLSIG+, the reduced field E/N is usually
defined as the ratio of the electric field to the neutral particle
density, . However, the neutral particle number density can drop to
negligible values. Thus, the reduced field tends toward infinity and the
electron temperature increases above reasonable values. Therefore, we
define N as the heavy particle density, i.e. N = + [26,86]. This
assumption, initially proposed in [26,86], was also successfully
employed in [116].

In Figure 9, the experimental current going through the discharge gap
has been reconstructed by synchronizing and summing the incident and
reflected current pulses. For t < 4 ns, the typical diameter of the
partially ionized plasma is [25], which corresponds to current densities
of typically found in non-thermal sparks [21,23]. Similar values are
found in the simulation up to t = 4 ns. Near t = 4 - 8 ns, the optical
diameter measured with the ionic lines is ~1 (Figure 6) and the measured
current reaches , which corresponds to when the simulation predicts a
lower value ( ). Several phenomena could explain this difference:

- 1.  The current density measurement is rather sensitive to the
      discharge diameter measurement, because , and this difference
      could be reduced if the diameter were a few m larger.
- 2.  As observed in [36], there could be a multi-filament structure
      partially out of the spectrometer field of view.

3.  Finally, parallel to the fully ionized core ( ), a portion of the
    current might flow through an outer shell of the plasma channel ( )
    and have a non-negligible contribution. For instance, assuming the
    current flowing through the outer shell is the same after the
    filament formation (i.e. ) would reduce the experimental current
    density in the core down to .

Finally, for ns, the current is still ~100 A but the diameter increases
to 10 µm, which decreases the measured current density down to A·cm-2,
close to what the simulation indicates.

Figure 10 Simplified discharge diameter evolution (red) used to compute
the deposited energy (black) in the 0-D approximation from the simulated
power (blue). The numerical value of the deposited energy (3.7 mJ) is
close to the experimental one (2.5 mJ).

From our measurements in Section 3.b, a simplified evolution of the
discharge diameter is used to calculate the deposited power, see Figure
10. The discharge power, P [W], is calculated from the power density,
[W·cm-3], multiplied by the discharge volume. The deposited energy,
shown in Figure 10 from the time integration of P, starts increasing
from t=0 ns, which corresponds to our first measurement of the electron
number density by Stark broadening. From 0 ns to 4 ns, the discharge
diameter is assumed to be constant ( ), as documented in our previous
work [25]. The deposited energy sharply increases up to ~ 3.6 mJ, close
to the experimental value of 2.5 mJ. From this time step, the discharge
diameter drops, as shown by sub-nanosecond imaging in [25], down to .
For t > 4 ns, the diameter is assumed to increase linearly, see Section
3.b. This small diameter compensates for a high power density of and the
deposited energy slowly varies for t > 4 ns. The presence of an outer
shell of a partially ionized plasma ( and ) would only slightly increase
the total deposited energy by a few mJ.

Based on the current and energy comparison performed in this subsection,
we consider the 0-D formalism sufficient to reproduce the main trends of
the thermal spark formation. In the following subsection, the channels
of electron formation are identified and compared to the experimental
trends.

b. Comparison to optical measurements

Figure 11 Evolution of the species number densities and temperature
during the thermal spark transition in air. Atomic O and are omitted for
clarity, but they follow the same trends as N and .

In this section, we compare the optical measurements near the cathode
and the simulation. The evolution of the plasma composition is shown in
Figure 11 and follows the same behavior as the one reported in our
previous work [26]. It is convenient to describe the number density
evolution with, in Figure 12, the normalized electron number density
variations, [s-1], and the ionization frequency, [s-1], of reaction k
where [cm-3·s-1] is the electron production rate of reaction k and
[cm-3·s-1] the recombination rate in the reverse direction:

Eq. 16

Eq. 17

For t < 1 ns and according to the data in Figure 11 and Figure 12, the
plasma remains partially ionized and is mostly composed of and . At t =
1 ns, atomic nitrogen is quickly formed via the dissociation of
electronic states of N2 [26,42]. Ionization is driven by electron-impact
on N2 and O2, while the ionization of N2 excited electronic states gets
stronger than that of O2. The ionization fraction reaches ~1% and ~10%
of N2 is dissociated into N. The ionization frequencies by electron
impact on and are approximately equal but, for t > 1 ns, are both
decreasing with time due to molecular dissociation, see Figure 12
(left). This fall of the ionization frequency from and for t > 1 ns is
compensated by an increase of the ionization frequency of N. The
dissociative recombination of NO+, N2+, and O2+ induces a non-negligible
drop in the total ionization frequency remaining near 1 GHz. The
ionization frequency by N, , is first dominated by N( D0), see Figure 12
(right). From t > 1 ns, the ionization frequencies from states above
N(2D0) start dominating the ionization process. In practice, the
addition of states higher than N(4P) at 10.92 eV does not significantly
alter the kinetics of electron formation (comparison not shown). Near t
= 3 ns, the dissociative recombination of molecules is negligible, and
the reverse rate of N and O ionization is the dominant recombination
channel. At this instant and in an interval of ns, gains almost three
orders of magnitude. Consequently, the ion-electron thermalization time,
inversely proportional to , significantly decreases below the nanosecond
scale [1,26]. This sharp increase of drives the translational
temperature thermalization with via electron-ion collisions, see also
Figure 8 of [26]. The translational temperature, in Figure 11, reaches
values near 10,000 K, below the ~30,000 K simulated in our previous work
[26] and Shcherbanev et al. [42] because E/N quickly drops below 50 Td.
Note that if these simulations included the magnetic compression effect,
the translational temperature would be higher, but the inclusion of this
effect falls outside of the presented 0-D formalism. After t = 4 ns, the
plasma is fully ionized and composed mainly of electrons, N+ and O+.

Figure 12 Evolution of the effective ionization frequency, in dashed
black, compared to the ionization frequency through the channels of
ionization, in full lines. (left) Sum of the ionization channels by
electron impact of , , and . Only the major channels are shown and the
recombination channels are hidden for clarity. (right) Detailed
contributions of each electronic state of .

The sharp increase of the ionization frequency at t = 3.5 ns is also
influenced by the following mechanism. The increase of induces a faster
ionization rate (by electron impact) and a faster formation of N* and O*
(by electron impact). The ionization cross-sections of these electronic
states present higher amplitudes and lower ionization thresholds than
those of the electronic ground state. In parallel, the increase of
shifts the underpopulated high-energy tail of the EEDF closer to a
Boltzmann distribution, see for instance Figure 9 of [26]. Therefore,
the ionization rate is significantly increased. All these retroactive
loops lead to a dramatic increase in the electron number density.

Figure 13 Comparison of the electron number density obtained by
simulation (black solid line) with measurements performed by Stark
broadening and continuum emission. Full ionization is not reached if the
simulation is run without the ionization of O and N excited states (red
solid line).

Figure 13 compares the evolution of the electron number density measured
with Stark broadening of , Stark broadening of , and the
free-free-free-bound continuum, with the electron number density
calculated with our kinetic mechanism. The “1-level model” corresponds
to the mechanism of Section 4.c with all reactions except the formation
and ionization of and . In this case, reaches at most cm-3 at the end of
the 10-ns pulse. With the “Full mechanism”, the electron-impact
ionization of the first eight electronic states of N and three
electronic states of O is added. The very abrupt ionization phase
matches the one observed in the experiments. Note that the two
simulations agree for t < 1 ns as expected when, below an ionization
fraction of 1%, the kinetics of atomic excited electronic states is not
primarily driving the chemistry.

The decay of at later times is due to an isentropic expansion lasting
more than 100 ns [25,28]. In these simulations, it was assumed that the
discharge volume is constant, which is usually correct in non-thermal
nanosecond discharges. We believe that the agreement would be improved
if the model included the plasma channel expansion, which could begin as
early as t = 6 ns, see also Figure 6. The consideration of the radiative
losses, which could be non-negligible but not dominant (see [25,26]),
would also represent an improvement [117]. Although this 0-D
approximation is suitable for capturing the main trends of the thermal
spark formation, a 1-D formalism would also be helpful to quantitatively
assess the second-order influence of the magnetic compression.

6. Conclusions

In this work, we study the formation of thermal sparks generated at
ambient conditions by an 8-kV pulse of 10 ns across a 1.2-mm gap. In the
first part, the increase of the electron number density near the cathode
is measured using several optical emission spectroscopy methods. First,
the Stark broadening of , at 656 nm, and , at 500 nm, are used. Then,
after intensity calibration of the emission spectrum near nm, the
optical diameter of the discharge is obtained with sub-nanosecond
resolution from atomic ion lines by assuming plasma neutrality. This
diameter indicates that magnetic compression is likely to play a role
during a few nanoseconds and is later used to determine the electron
number density via the continuum radiation near nm. The three methods
used to measure agree with one another and show that the thermal spark’s
full ionization occurs on a timescale of approximately 0.5 ns.

In the second part of this article, a 0-D kinetic mechanism is developed
to explain the observed abrupt increase of the ionization degree of the
nanosecond thermal spark. The mechanism includes , , NO, N, O, , , , , ,
, and species. The novelty of the present kinetic mechanism is the
addition of the ionization of the excited electronic states of N and O
by electron impact. These reactions are found to be essential to
reproduce the experimental data obtained in the first part of the
article. The agreement between simulations and experiments strongly
supports the key role of the atomic excited states in the ionization of
the thermal spark filaments. However, the topology and the propagation
of the fully ionized filaments remain unclear and require further
investigation. Including the electron-impact ionization of N and N0
excited states in 1-D or 2-D simulations, together with incorporating
plasma-electrode interactions, runaway electrons, magnetic compression,
radiation, and ionization wave propagation would help to further
describe the nanosecond thermal spark.
