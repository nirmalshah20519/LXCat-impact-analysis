Abstract

This work proposes a complete and consistent set of cross sections (CS)
for electron collisions with water gas molecules to be published in the
IST-Lisbon database on LXCat. The set is validated by the electron swarm
analysis technique. The anisotropic angular distribution of electrons in
rotational collisions is considered by means of the Born approximation
in a two-term Boltzmann solver (LisbOn KInetics two-term Boltzmann
solver (LoKI-B)) and a Monte Carlo simulations code (LoKI-MC), both
freely available as open-source codes. The inclusion of electron
anisotropic scattering in rotational collisions significantly improves
the agreement between calculations and measurements of the electron
drift velocity, reduced mobility, characteristic energy, reduced
Townsend ionisation coefficient, reduced effective Townsend coefficient
and reduced attachment coefficient. The MC simulations are deemed more
accurate and shown to yield similar results as LoKI-B with the proposed
set. The use of LoKI-MC also validates the set of CSs against parameters
that cannot be obtained by LoKI-B, such as the longitudinal diffusion
coefficient or the bulk transport coefficients.

1. Introduction

From a scientific standpoint, the importance of water goes way beyond
merely forming the foundation of life on Earth. For instance, water
molecules (H2O) can serve as abundant hydrogen source in plasma gas
conversion[1, 2] or surface functionalisation[3], as probe in
atmospheric[4] or astronomic environments [5], as prominent constituent
in primordial Earth’s atmosphere [6] or as direct target of processing
like water purification [7]. On top of that, water is an impurity
present in many applications [8, 9]. A common denominator of all
mentioned situations is the importance of collisions between electrons
and H2O.

Very complex environments are formed within which collisions between
electrons and H2O induce various molecular processes like rotational,
vibrational and electronic excitation, dissociation, electron attachment
or ionisation, that must all be taken into account in an accurate and
complete description. While experiments grant valuable insights into
these environments, often simulations are vital for their interpretation
and fundamental understanding [10]. In turn, the significance of
simulation outcomes relies on the validity of input data.

Since the collision-induced processes dictate the overall behaviour of
the system, electron-neutral collision cross sections (CSs) play an
important part as simulation input. There has been a lot of discussion
in the community on which H2O CSs to use, with many groups proposing
different sets [11–13], as extensively discussed in[14]. Recently, we
have also made available a CS set for electrons in H2O vapour[14] in the
IST-Lisbon database [15] on LXCat[16]. Under the assumption of isotropic
scattering in inelastic collisions, the CSs have been optimised with the
electron swarm analysis technique [17] using the LisbOn KInetics
two-term Boltzmann solver (LoKI-B) [18] to obtain a complete CS set, in
the following called the isotropic set, that is consistent with
experiments.

The isotropic set comes with the advantage of compatibility with widely
used space-homogeneous two-term Boltzmann solvers allowing for immediate
improvement of existing lowtemperature plasma models.

In this paper, we extend the study in our previous work[14].
Specifically, we test the impact of anisotropic scattering for
rotational collisions and the validity of the electron-H2O collision CS
set derived from LoKI-B beyond the two-term approximation, leading to
what is henceforth called the anisotropic set.

Rotational collisions are known to be particularly important for
low-energy electrons[19]. In fact, the rotations of H2O are the main
reason for the ongoing controversy in the community about which CSs to
use. Different descriptions have been proposed [12, 20, 21] including
either state-to-state transitions [12], lumped CSs [13, 22, 23] or
anisotropic rotational CSs [24]. In our isotropic set a large number of
147 rotational transitions is included to ensure an accurate description
of the electron kinetics[14]. A scaling factor of 0.3 and a cut-off
beyond 12 eV are introduced in the calculation of the rotational CSs
[25], so as to obtain agreement with experimental electron transport
coefficients4 . In the present publication, a more thorough description
of the rotations through inclusion of the anisotropy [26] of the
scattering process is provided. The inclusion of anisotropic scattering
is justified from our previous work on electrons in CO, where forward
angular scattering for rotational collisions has been demonstrated to
have a large impact in the calculations of electron transport
coefficients for reduced electric fields E/N ⩽ 1Td (1Td = 1 × 10−21 V m2
) [26], leading to an improved agreement with experiments.

Two-term electron Boltzmann solvers such as LoKI-B [18] or BOLSIG+ [27]
are fast and reasonably accurate tools available to the community for
the calculation of the electron energy distributions function (EEDF)
[10]. Underlying assumptions, e.g. small anisotropy in the electron
velocity distribution that allows for discarding the Legendre-polynomial
development of the electron distribution function after the first order
term, simplify the problem significantly. However, in the presence of
significant inelastic collisions for electrons with molecules two-term
Boltzmann solvers should be applied with care [28], due to the implied
small anisotropy assumption for the electron velocity distribution
function. Moreover, only socalled flux transport parameters have been
considered in our previous study, whereas so-called bulk parameters[29,
30] are considered here as well. The difference between bulk and flux is
explained best by means of the drift velocity: the flux drift velocity
is the average velocity of the electron swarm, while the bulk drift
velocity is the change of the position of the centre of mass of the
swarm[29]. Differences between the two occur at E/N for which there is a
significant contribution of non-conservative processes like attachment
or ionisation[28]. Codes based on density gradient expansion of the
electron distribution function or the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation method
are capable of providing bulk parameters though [31]. It is worth
mentioning that two-term Boltzmann solvers are not the standard in the
optimisation of CSs but often more precise methods like multi-term
expansion or MC simulation codes are used. Using two-term-derived CSs in
more exact calculations might lead to deviations. The consistent use of
a two-term Boltzmann solver to first obtain those CSs and afterwards
yield a correct EEDF using the CSs, see also figure 6, then might serve
as basis for plasma modelling regardless[32].

Herein, we present a complete and consistent anisotropic set of
electron-neutral collision CSs for electrons in water vapour to the
community. Usability is ensured through the latest releases of the
LisbOn KInetics open-source codes[33], namely the two-term Boltzmann
solver LoKI-B [18] and the MC simulation tool LoKI-MC [34], both
including anisotropic scattering. The latter validates the proposed
anisotropic CS set at high E/N conditions where the two-term Boltzmann
solver may fail and extend the comparison with experiment to bulk
transport coefficients. The new set can significantly improve

parameter instead of transport coefficient.

plasma models, which will promote the understanding and tailoring of
experiments and applications.

The outline of this manuscript is as follows. Section 2 establishes
anisotropic electron scattering by in a general manner before detailing
the implementation in a two-term Boltzmann solver and a MC simulation
code. Section 3 presents the anisotropic CS set obtained and validated
from the electron swarm analysis method, as demonstrated in section 4.
Afterwards, section 5 elaborates on the effect of changing the gas
temperature on the calculated electron transport coefficients for both
isotropic and anisotropic sets of CSs. Finally, the most important
findings of the study are summarised in section 6.

2. Anisotropic scattering in dipole rotational collisions

This section introduces the concept of anisotropic rotational collisions
of electrons with water molecules and details how the anisotropy is
included in the used codes, namely the two-term Boltzmann solver LoKI-B
[18] and the MC simulations code LoKI-MC [34].

Before addressing anisotropic scattering, the proper notation of the
rotational quantum state of must be clarified. Since it has been
introduced in a preceding paper [14], only a summary is given here. The
molecule is an asymmetrictop rotor whose rotational quantum state J is
characterised by three quantum numbers: the principal rotational quantum
number J (not to be confused with the notation of the rotational state
itself J), K’ and K’’, which represent the projection of J along the
axis of smallest and largest moment of inertia, respectively. The latter
two are often combined to the pseudo-quantum number . The rotational
state is then given as [14, 35].

2.1. Differential cross section (DCS) for rotational collisions of electrons in water vapour

The kinematics of a scattering event i is ruled by its DCS , where is
the incident electron energy, is the polar scattering angle and is the
differential solid angle, assuming symmetry regarding the azimuthal
angle . In the case of dipole transitions in asymmetric-top rotor
molecules like water, Itikawa derived the following expression under the
Born approximation [25, 36]

where primed quantities are after the collision, D = 0.728 is the dipole
moment of water in atomic units and is the line strength of the
rotational transition [37], which is taken from King et al [38]. In
fact, the Born approximation is a simplification as for instance
short-range effects and the polar nature of are neglected. As has been
shown, the approximation is

however often still valid even for low electron energies since the
effective interaction occurs distant from the molecule. The wave
function of the incident electron is then only marginally distorted [26,
39, 40]. See particularly Vialetto et al for an indepth discussion [26].

By integrating the DCS over the solid angle and assuming azimuthal
symmetry, we obtain the integral cross section (ICS):

where is the absolute difference between the energies of the final and
initial rotational states. Additionally, we can define the angular
distribution function by normalising the DCS with the ICS:

This function provides insight about the angular distribution of the
scattered electrons, independently of the ICS of the collisional
process. Taking into account equations (1) and (2), the angular
distribution function in dipole-rotational collisions is written as

(4) 

The angular distribution function given by equation (4) is plotted in
figure 1 for the transition from to . The long-range dipole interaction
yields a highly anisotropic angular distribution where small-angle
scattering is dominant, with an increasing effect with electron energy.

Finally, using the classical definition of the momentum transfer cross
section (MTCS) [41],

for dipole rotational collisions in water, the MTCS is given by,

This component is important for the inclusion of anisotropic scattering
in a two-term solver, as shown in the next section. Note that the MTCS
definition is not unique and some

rotational transition in water from to , whose threshold is eV.

authors [42] consider a different formula for inelastic processes. This
is extensively discussed in [26]. In this paper, whenever talking about
momentum transfer, we refer to the definition (5).

2.2. Anisotropic scattering in a two-term Boltzmann solver

The inclusion of anisotropic scattering in the two-term Boltzmann
equation is detailed in [26]. Here, we focus on the main aspects.

Under azimuthal symmetry, similarly to what is done for the electron
velocity distribution, the DCS can be expressed as an expansion in
Legendre polynomials [43],

where the terms are the jth partial cross sections (PCSs), which can be
obtained using the orthogonality relation of the Legendre polynomials:

Notice that the zeroth PCS is always equal to the ICS and the first PCS
vanishes for isotropic processes. Moreover, the MTCS defined in (5) can
be written as a function of the first two PCSs:

Using the two-term approximation, the anisotropic collisional effects
can be considered by extending the total (effective) electron-neutral CS
for momentum transfer in the following way:

where is the fraction of molecules in state k, is the first anisotropic
component of the normalised electron velocity distribution and is the
absolute energy difference between the two involved states. The first
group of terms represents, in order, the momentum transfer due to
elastic collisions with molecules in state k, electron-impact
excitations and de-excitations . This part is identical to what is
implemented in most two-term Boltzmann solvers, describing the loss of
momentum in isotropic collisions. The second and third group consist of
the first order corrections due to the anisotropic nature of excitations
and de-excitations, respectively.

Take note that the superelastic PCSs are obtained through the
microreversibility relation, expressing the principle of detailed
balance [44]:

where and denote the statistical weights of the levels k and l,
respectively.

As evidenced in figure 1, the angular distribution in rotational
collisions of is highly anisotropic and the extended total CS in
equation (10) is required. However, the anisotropic terms can be further
simplified for rotational collisions. Unless the incident electron
energy is very low, the difference between the electron energies before
and after rotational collisions can be neglected such that .
Consequently, and the contribution of the rotational collisions for
momentum transfer can be approximately written as

where in the last term equation (9) was used. In other words, in
low-energy threshold processes such as rotational collisions, the
anisotropy can be approximately considered by replacing the ICSs of
rotational collisions by the MTCSs.

Expression (12) is implemented in the latest version of LoKI-B [18] and
is used in the present simulations. Pay attention that in the case of
other collisional processes, e.g. vibrational and electronic
excitations/de-excitations, the original form in (10) should be used
instead.

2.3. Anisotropic scattering in a MC solver

The MC method used in LoKI-MC is described in [34]. In short, it
simulates the accelerated electron transport in a background gas by
following the stochastic trajectory of a representative ensemble of
electrons. Each electron performs a series of free flights interrupted
by elastic, inelastic or superelastic collisions with gas molecules. The
collision-free times and the collision dynamics are calculated by
generating random numbers sampled from probability distributions based
on the underlying physics. During the simulation, the information of the
electrons is stored in order to calculate distribution functions,
transport coefficients and other relevant quantities.

In the first code release, with the exception of ionisation, electron
collisions are assumed isotropic. Here, we generalise its application to
anisotropic scattering based on the work by Vialetto et al [26], to be
included in the next release. The scattering angles after
electron-molecule collisions can be sampled according to a theorem of
probability [45], by inverting the following equation:

where is a random number uniformly distributed between 0 and 1, and the
scattering angle is randomly distributed according to a probability
distribution function that is normalised to 1 in . We should remark that
this procedure is general and valid for any kind of electron-impact
process. Contrarily to the two-term solution, no approximations are
needed to include anisotropic scattering. Upon the knowledge of ,
equation (13) can be inverted to obtain .

For dipole-Born interactions, the substitution of equation (4) into (13)
leads to [26]:

where the energy-dependent variable is given by:

and the minus (plus) sign corresponds to the inelastic (superelastic)
process. In this way, dipole-Born anisotropic scattering is rigorously
included in the MC algorithm and we can quantify the accuracy of the
approximations made in the twoterm Boltzmann solver.

3. Anisotropic CS set

The complete anisotropic CS set proposed in this paper is plotted
against the electron energy in figure 2. The CSs are grouped in
conservative processes with a constant number of

, divided into conservative and non-conservative collisional processes.
ICS and MTCS (dashed lines) are the sums of all individual rotational
cross sections weighted by the populations of the lower rotational
levels assuming a Boltzmann distribution at 293 K. In the left-side
panel, the elastic and rotational cross section extend down to sub-meV
range which is not shown for better visibility of the remaining
conservative collision cross sections. CSs are obtained from [22, 25,
48–56]. See the main text and [14] for more details.

electrons on the left and non-conservative processes, i.e. ionisation
and attachment, on the right. With the exception of rotational
processes, the anisotropic set is entirely equal to the isotropic set of
[14]. For that reason, differences of the optimised CSs in the isotropic
set with respect to the original references are only briefly addressed
here before focusing on the rotational CSs and the reader is referred to
[14] for details. In short, to improve the agreement with experimental
transport coefficients with the isotropic set, in [14] the original CSs
for , and are multiplied with a constant factor within their range of
uncertainty, the high-energy tail of the elastic CS is slightly
decreased and the effective excitation CS leading to is introduced.

In the isotropic set, the rotational ICSs are decreased by a factor 0.3
relatively to equation (2) and set to zero after 12 eV, to compensate
for the isotropic assumption. In that case, no additional MTCSs are
needed since they are equal to the ICSs. In the anisotropic set proposed
here, the ICSs and MTCSs are calculated entirely according to equations
(2) and (6), with no modification. This approach leads to a
significantly better agreement with experiments, as is shown in section
4. To put the proposed rotational CSs into perspective, figure 3 shows
the CS for the rotational transition . Dashed lines correspond to CSs
that we propose in this publication (light blue lines) or in the
previous isotropic set (grey line) [14], all based on the Born
approximation. The dashdotted blue line is taken from [20] including a
short-range correction to the Born approximation based on R-matrix
calculations with a fixed-nuclei approximation. The solid green line is
taken from the supplementary material of [13] that is in principle based
on [20]. Note that [13] recommends only the highenergy part of the CS
beyond the maximum. From figure 3, a

means of the rotational transition (JK′K ′ ′) = (000) → (111). Dashed
lines correspond to CSs that we recommend either here (light blue lines)
or in our isotropic set (grey line)[14]. The dash-dotted dark blue line
is taken from Faure et al [21] and the solid green line from Song et al
[13].

clear difference between the simple Born approximation and the more
sophisticated approach is seen. The discussion of the best rotational
CSs is ongoing and is not to be settled by the present study as the
electron swarm analysis method yields an optimised set of CS but does
not allow for conclusions about individual CSs. The conclusion that can
be drawn though, is that our proposed anisotropic CS set yields
excellent agreement with experimental electron transport coefficients as
is shown in section 4.

The inclusion of anisotropic scattering is limited to rotational
collisions in the present set. We specifically decided to focus on
anisotropic scattering in low-energy threshold rotational collisions for
two reasons. On the one hand, this is motivated by the fact that
anisotropic scattering in dipole rotational collisions has been
demonstrated to have large effects on calculated electron transport
coefficients [26]. On the other hand, it has been shown that the choice
of the angular scattering model for higher energy threshold conservative
collisions has only a minor influence on the calculated electron
transport coefficients[46, 47]. The present results confirm these
observations from literature as good agreement between experimental and
calculated transport coefficients for low E/N is obtained with only
anisotropic rotational scattering while isotropic scattering is
sufficient for the remaining collisional processes. It is worth
mentioning however that equations (10) and(13) are general and can
principally be applied to any scattering process.

In summary, the anisotropic set includes one elastic[48], 147 rotational
integral and 147 rotational momentum transfer [25], two vibrational [49,
50], three electronic excitation[51, 52], three dissociation [53–55],
three dissociative attachment[22, 48] and five ionisation CSs[56]. In
figure 2, the sum of all individual ICSs and MTCSs, see equations (2)
and (6), weighted by the population of the lower rotational state is
shown (dashed lines) for illustration. In total 310 CSs, where 294 = 2 ×
147 = nICS + nMTCS are rotational CSs, are included. However, note that
the rotational MTCSs are not used for LoKI-MC calculations, since the
anisotropic angular distribution is directly taken into account in the
generation of the scattering angle, see section 2. The reader is
referred to [14] for more details on the CS set.

4. Validation

The complete CS set of figure 2 is validated by the electron swarm
technique using the two-term Boltzmann solver LoKI-B[18] and the MC
simulation tool LoKI-MC[34], both freely available as open-source codes
[33]. Anisotropic rotational scattering is included in both solvers
through the methods described in section 2. The setup files required to
run the codes are provided as supplementary material.

Contrarily to the recommendation in[14], where it is suggested to
discretise the energy axis of the LoKI-B simulations in 2000 cells, as a
good compromise between accuracy and computation time, here the energy
axis is discretised in 8000 cells to facilitate the comparison between
the isotropic and anisotropic sets. This large cell number assures an
accurate treatment of the low-energy thresholds of the rotational CSs
[14]. Note that the maximum energy of the grid is dynamically adjusted
[18]. It is between 0.8 eV for lowest and 140 eV for highest E/N used,
respectively, divided into the abovementioned number of equally sized
cells. The LoKI-MC simulations follow the dynamics of an ensemble of 2 ×
105 electrons. After the electron swarm relaxes to a stationary state,
the transport coefficients are calculated by averaging over all
electrons at 105 fixed time instants. The standard deviation for the
coefficients shown in this work is always below 1%. For more details,
see section 2.6 of [34].

The electron transport coefficients collected from literature have been
presented already in a previous publication[14]. Briefly, they are the
electron drift velocity vD [57–66], the reduced mobility µN [57], the
characteristic energy εchar = DT/µ [67, 68], the reduced Townsend
coefficient α/N [69, 70], the reduced attachment coefficient η/N [67,
69–72] and the reduced effective Townsend coefficient, defined as the
difference of the latter two[59, 69, 70]. Here, N is the total gas
number density, µ the electron mobility, DT the transverse diffusion
coefficient, α the Townsend coefficient and η the attachment
coefficient. When not given explicitly, the reduced mobility is
calculated from µN = vDN/E with E being the electric field. In contrast
to the space-homogeneous two-term Boltzmann solver LoKI-B, MC and
density gradient expansion codes can also provide the reduced
longitudinal diffusion coefficient DLN [64, 73], allowing to extend the
validation to one more parameter, and bulk transport parameters for
comparison with the experimental values for high E/N values.

Special attention should be taken on how the transport coefficients are
measured to optimally compare them with calculations. On the one hand,
in time-of-flight (TOF) experiments the electron number is growing in
time. Drift velocity and diffusion coefficients are measured in TOF
conditions. On the other hand, Townsend and attachment coefficients are
usually measured in so-called steady state Townsend (SST) conditions,
i.e. with the electron number growing in space. Both TOF and SST
measurements usually yield bulk transport coefficients [29, 30], see
also the discussion of flux and bulk coefficients in section 15.

In the calculations, the measurements are emulated by making use of the
concepts of temporal/spatial growth as introduced by Hagelaar and
Pitchford [27], where first the energy dependence of the electron
distribution function is separated from the time- and space-dependent
electron density before in a simplifying step it is either assumed that
grows exclusively in time with a net production frequency or in space
with a constant net spatial grow rate [27]. These concepts are borrowed
by LoKI-B [18]. On the contrary, the current version of LoKI-MC
simulates only TOF configurations. However, the Townsend and attachment
coefficients in SST conditions can be derived from the TOF bulk
parameters using the following approximate relation in equation (16)
deduced from [31, 74, 75]:

(16) 

where is the SST ionisation coefficient; is the SST drift velocity; is
the effective ionisation rate-coefficient; and are the bulk components
of the drift velocity and longitudinal diffusion coefficient,
respectively, calculated in a TOF simulation. A similar expression for
the attachment coefficient is used, with instead of .

Figure 4 demonstrates the agreement between the calculated transport
coefficients (lines) with the experimentally determined ones from
literature (markers). Please pay attention that and (both y-axis labels
on the right) are plotted linearly while all other parameters are
presented in logarithmic scale. Whenever known, the uncertainty of the
experimental electron transport coefficients is shown as error bars.
From top to bottom, , , , , and are plotted. Note that compared to [14],
the E/N range below 9 Td is not shown since no difference is observable
there between the isotropic and anisotropic sets and for better
visibility of the differences of the remaining data. We refer to [14]
for a discussion of the electron transport coefficients. According to
the discussion in the preceding paragraph and as indicated by the arrows
in the centre two panels, , and are calculated under TOF conditions with
temporal growth of the electron number while , and are calculated under
SST conditions with spatial growth of the electron number.

In figure 4, we see how the good agreement of the calculation using the
isotropic set in LoKI-B (solid green line) with the experimental values
is further improved when the anisotropy of the rotational collisions is
taken into account (dashed magenta line). In particular, excellent
accordance is found now

in and . The calculated values of and agree very well with the
experiment and are rather similar for both sets, except for a small
shift in for E/N below 70 Td, comparable with the dispersion of the
experimental points. Moreover, it should be noted that effects of
anisotropic scattering for rotational collisions appear to be relevant
still for E/N > 80 Td. This is an important difference with respect to
results obtained for electrons in CO [26], where anisotropic scattering
is relevant only for E/N < 5 Td. It is related to the different dipole
moment magnitude, i.e. 0.728 for H2O compared with 0.0432 for CO, and to
the shape of elastic MTCSs for the two molecules.

A just as excellent agreement with experimental data can be seen in
figure 4 when using LoKI-MC. In particular, the flux results from
LoKI-MC (dash-dotted blue line) almost perfectly align with the
anisotropic results obtained from LoKI-B.

When ionisation and attachment start to play a major role, the split
between the flux and bulk components (dotted light blue line) can be
evidenced from for E/N > 100 Td in figure 4. In fact, within a careful
analysis these details can be accounted for [23, 29]. However
considering the overall spread of the experimental data, it is noted
that both flux and bulk calculated components follow the experiments
fairly well with about 20% difference between the two. In total, it is
the agreement with the bulk parameters, despite the fact that they were
not considered in the previous work, that should be emphasised.

The experimental longitudinal diffusion coefficient times gas number
density is plotted in figure 5 against the reduced electric field
together with calculation results from LoKI-MC using both the
anisotropic and isotropic sets. Although the results with the isotropic
set are satisfactory, the rigorous inclusion of anisotropic scattering
remarkably improves the agreement with experiment for E/N below 100 Td.
Furthermore, it should be emphasised that the proposed CS set gives good
agreement (i) with a transport coefficient that at no point has been
used for the optimisation of the set as it is not accessible with the
used two-term code and (ii) using the MC instead of the two-term
approach. It is worth highlighting that the second point is not
guaranteed when using a CS set optimised with the two-term approximation
in a more accurate methodology like MC simulation [32]. In figure 6, we
also show that the EEDFs for both calculation methods agree very well.
This underlines the validity and wide applicability of the proposed CS
set.

5. Effect of the gas temperature

As elaborated in [14], experimental electron transport coefficients for
are only reliably provided close to room temperature. For that reason,
it was sufficient to run all simulation up to this point at gas
temperature .

As the rotations are treated slightly different in isotropic and
anisotropic CS set, it is worthwhile to compare how both sets behave
with changing . Specifically, with changing gas temperature the
populations of rotational and vibrational

can be converted to bulk data following the corrections in [29].

when known with error bars, with those obtained from LoKI-B or LoKI-MC
simulations with the proposed isotropic[14] and anisotropic cross
section sets (lines). References to the experimental transport
coefficients can be found in the text. As indicated by the arrows in the
centre two panels, vD, µN and εchar are calculated assuming temporal
growth of the electron number while for α/N and η/N spatial growth is
assumed. LoKI-B provides exclusively flux transport coefficients and all
shown LoKI-MC results include anisotropic rotational scattering.

levels, both assumed to follow a Boltzmann distribution at Tgas, are
changing. The larger the population in a certain level is, the more
important transitions starting from that level get

in shaping the EEDF. In turn, also the transport coefficients calculated
from the EEDF change. For illustration, figure 7 exemplarily shows εchar
in panel (a) and µN in panel (b)

calculated with LoKI-B using the isotropic (solid lines) or anisotropic
CS set (dashed lines) for different temperatures. The markers represent
experimental transport coefficients, see section 4.

The blue lines in figure 7, exhibiting the best agreement with the
experimental transport coefficients, correspond to the calculations at
293 K that are already plotted in figure 4. Without going into too much
detail, we note that (i) with changing Tgas the lines start to deviate
from the experiments at room temperature, as expected, and (ii) the
discrepancy between the isotropic and anisotropic set also changes as a
function of temperature. The second point is particularly well observed
for the reduced mobility in figure 7(b) at high temperature (yellow),
where there is a difference between the two calculations over the full
E/N-range. This finding suggests that measurements of electron transport
coefficients in H2O at different Tgas are very much sought after to
further validate the present set of electron-impact CSs. Finally, we
should underline that a set with lumped rotational CSs would not be able
to describe the same behaviour with Tgas, since it would miss the
important effect of the change in rotational populations.

6. Conclusion

Even though water molecules are frequently encountered in many
innovative plasma applications, there is room for improvement of the
H2O-electron collision CSs which are required for the determination of
the EEDF. In particular, since water molecules are asymmetric-top rotors
with permanent dipole moment, the rigorous inclusion of electron-impact
rotational collisions is rather challenging.

In a previous work[14], we presented a complete CS set for H2O, under
the typical isotropic assumption present in most electron Boltzmann
two-term solvers. Since the rotational collisions in H2O are highly
anisotropic, the corresponding CSs were artificially decreased in [14]
so as to diminish the momentum transfer due to these processes. This
approach was validated against experimental measurements, but there were
still visible deviations between the calculations and the experimental
data in the reduced mobility and the characteristic energy.

In this work, we pursued a different path and included the influence of
anisotropic electron scattering in rotational collisions. Without
modifying the CS of any other process besides rotations and using
directly the rotational CSs from dipole-Born theory, the agreement with
experiment for the mobility and the characteristic energy is now
excellent as well.

The usage of the MC simulations code LoKI-MC allowed us to gain insight
into the applicability of the present CS set that must be assumed a
priori to be limited to two-term Boltzmann solvers as used for its
derivation. First, we could verify that the electron transport
coefficients calculated with the two-term Boltzmann solver LoKI-B agree
very well with the MC solution, both when using the isotropic or the
anisotropic sets. Note, that this agreement is somewhat coincidental and
not due to a firm physical background. We conclude that there is a de
facto a posteriori verification that the two-term approximation yields
accurate results with the developed CS set for H2O and that the set is
not exclusively suited for use in two-term Boltzmann solvers but also in
the more accurate MC simulation method. Additionally, we could extend
the validation to parameters that cannot be obtained by LoKI-B, such as
the bulk transport coefficients or the longitudinal diffusion
coefficient. The excellent agreement between LoKI-MC calculations and
measurements of the latter, that were not considered in our previous
analysis, is a further confirmation of the validity of the present CS
set.

This work shows that the correct treatment of the angular distribution
of the scattered electrons is essential to have an accurate description
of electron swarms in water. This can be easily handled with the two
open-source codes LoKI-B and LoKI-MC.

The CS set developed here will be available in the IST-Lisbon database
on LXCat and can be used directly in LoKI-B and LoKI-MC to calculate
more accurate electron distribution functions and the corresponding
electron parameters leading to more refined plasma chemistry models. For
codes where anisotropic scattering cannot be included, the CS set
presented in our previous work[14] remains useful data to describe the
electron kinetics in systems containing water vapour.

In a future work, we plan to quantify the importance of anisotropic
scattering for the main gases of interest in the plasma community.
