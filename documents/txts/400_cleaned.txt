Abstract: Although the recently developed cutoff probe is a promising
tool to precisely infer plasma electron density by measuring the cutoff
frequency ( ) in the S21 spectrum, it is currently only applicable to
low-pressure plasma diagnostics below several torr. To improve the
cutoff probe, this paper proposes a novel method to measure the crossing
frequency ( ), which is applicable to high-pressure plasma diagnostics
where the conventional method does not operate. Here, is the frequency
where the S21 spectra in vacuum and plasma conditions cross each other.
This paper demonstrates the method through three-dimensional
electromagnetic wave simulation as well as experiments in a capacitively
coupled plasma source. Results demonstrate that the method operates well
at high pressure (several tens of torr) as well as low pressure. In
addition, through circuit model analysis, a method to estimate electron
density from is discussed. It is believed that the proposed method
expands the operating range of the cutoff probe and thus contributes to
its further development.

1. Introduction

Composed of physically energetic charged particles and chemically
reactive neutral particles, plasma has been widely used in various
fields including material fabrication and nuclear fusion as well as
medical, environmental, and aerospace industries [1,2]. Plasma
processing techniques such as plasma etching [3–7], ashing [8–11], and
deposition [12–16] are the most important steps to fabricate the
high-end memory and system semiconductors used in internet of things and
artificial intelligence technologies. For plasma deposition in
particular, plasma sputtering, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition
(PECVD), and plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) approaches
have been widely used for their high deposition rates, low-temperature
processing, good film conformality, and high film uniformity
[12,13,17,18].

In conventional deposition processing, trial-and-error methods were
first adopted to find the optimum process window [19]. However, these
days, such an approach seems ill-suited since the current challenges in
cutting-edge material fabrication involve processing steps that abruptly
increase and also involve complicated chemistries [1,3,4,12,13]. To
overcome this limitation, two alternatives have been proposed, namely
computer simulation and plasma internal parameter diagnostic methods
[20].

For the former, accompanied by the explosive improvements in computing
power, multiphysics methods allow us to simulate the plasma deposition
process, predict the processing results from plasma sputtering [21],
PECVD [22], and PEALD [23], and finally estimate the optimum process
window based on the results. However, there remains

a lack of basic atomic data especially for new complex precursors such
as bulk reaction cross sections, surface coefficients, and sputtering
and secondary electron emission yields [24]. Consequently, simulation is
at present applicable to specific processes using simple chemistries.

The latter, referring to methods that find the optimum process window
based on internal plasma parameters, has attracted great interest in
industrial as well as academic fields since plasma has an influence on
most chemical reactions contributing to the deposition process [25–28].
Specifically, electrons produce chemical species, which play a dominant
role in deposition chemistry, while energetic ions and metastables
activate the material surface, which enhances surface chemical reactions
[12,19]. Here, the plasma internal parameters include electron density,
electron temperature, ion flux, and ion energy distribution. Among them,
electron density is known as one of the most important parameters
because it is directly related to the deposition rate and processing
productivity [29,30].

Various plasma diagnostics to measure electron density have been
developed, such as the Langmuir probe measuring electron and ion current
[31,32], the line ratio method analyzing optical emission spectra by
excited atoms and molecules [33], the laser Thomson scattering method
measuring scattered laser light by electrons [34], and microwave probes
analyzing absorbed, reflected, and transmitted microwave signals
[35–38]. The Langmuir probe can infer various electron characteristics
such as electron density, temperature, and energy distribution, but is
not applicable to deposition processing since films deposited on the
probe tip block the conduction current, and the design of an RF filter
to block high-frequency noise is difficult [39]. As for the optical
methods, while the measurement of a plasma emission spectrum through a
viewport in a process chamber is relatively simple, these approaches are
only applicable to a narrow processing window since the emission
spectrum by each species overlaps, which complicates spectra analysis
[33]. The laser Thomson scattering method requires a large and stable
space to generate the laser and detect scattered light since the
detection signal is small. Furthermore, both optical and laser methods
are vulnerable to deposition on the viewport, which induces a decrease
in emission and scattered light signals.

On the other hand, the microwave probes are free from the issue of film
deposition on the probe antenna [40] as displacement current can flow
through a dielectric film. Furthermore, the microwave signal only
slightly distorts the processing plasma because the probes operate at
relatively low power, i.e., <1 mW [41], in comparison to common RF
powers ranging from several hundreds to thousands of watts. Hence,
microwave probes are seen as useful tools in deposition processing, and
various types of probes have been developed. Details of these probes,
such as the curling probe (CLP), the multipole resonance probe (MRP),
the cutoff probe (CP), etc., are well explained in [42,43].

Recently, microwave probes have been applied to measure the electron
density of deposition plasma. Styrnoll et al. applied the MRP to the
ion-assisted deposition used in optical coatings at a relatively low
pressure (<0.2 Torr) [44]. Ogawa et al. applied the CLP to a
hydrogenated amorphous carbon film deposition process (<0.01 Torr) [45],
and Lee et al. applied the CP to a fluorocarbon film deposition process
(<0.02 Torr) [7]. The probes in these works showed good performance in
measuring electron density during the deposition process at low
pressure.

However, based on the analysis in [46], the CLP and MRP might be seen as
unsuitable for high-pressure applications. The CP, likewise, has a
limitation for high-pressure plasma measurement [47–49]. Probe
performance reduction in such an environment results from frequent
electron–neutral collisions that decrease plasma–electromagnetic wave
interaction and diminish the resonant character of the probe system.
Accordingly, there is a great demand for the means to measure
high-pressure deposition plasma to analyze and optimize the deposition
process.

Considering that the CP is a promising microwave probe showing high
reproducibility and high accuracy [43,50,51], improvements of the CP for
high-pressure plasma meaSensors 2022, 22, 1291 3 of 11

surement are highly desirable. In the current paper, an alternative
method to measure electron density using the CP in a high-pressure
condition is proposed, called the crossing frequency method.

The remainder of this paper is as follows. In the second section,
simulation analysis for the crossing frequency method is given. In the
third section, experimental validation of the proposed method is given,
and a simple relation between electron density and crossing frequency is
presented. Finally, in the fourth section, a summary of this paper is
provided.

2. Simulation Demonstration

A commercial software to solve Maxwell’s equations in three-dimensional
space, Computer Simulation Technology (CST) MicroWave Studio Suite, was
adopted in this study. CST simulation is based on a finite-difference
time-domain method and is quite accurate compared with experiments [50].
This simulation considers plasma as a dispersive dielectric material,
called the Drude model, in which ions and electrons are immobile and
freely mobile, respectively, with a plasma dielectric constant ( ) given
by

(1) 

where j is a complex number, is the vacuum dielectric constant, is the
microwave frequency, (=8980 ) is the plasma oscillation frequency, is
the electron density in units of cm-3, and is the electron–neutral
collision frequency. Here, the dispersive dielectric material means that
its dielectric constant has frequency dependence. Equation (1) is used
to solve Maxwell’s equation inside the plasma domain. Here, for
simplicity, it is assumed that the electron–neutral elastic collision is
only considered for the calculation of between an electron and argon
atom at an electron temperature of 2 eV and a gas temperature of 300 K.
The 2 eV is a mean value commonly used in plasma processing. A
Maxwellian electron energy distribution is also assumed. Then, is equal
to in MHz, where p is the pressure in mTorr.

CST simulation provides several boundary conditions including electrical
ground, magnetic ground, open, and periodic conditions. To study
microwave probes, the electrical ground and open boundary conditions are
the most commonly used. To include vacuum chamber effects, the former is
usually applied, while to only consider the principal effect without any
boundary effects, the latter is typically used. In the current work, the
purpose of the simulation-based study was to investigate the basic
operation of the crossing frequency method, and so the open boundary
condition was applied to all simulation domain boundaries.

Figure 1 shows the simulation configuration, where the CP is immersed in
a uniform rectangular plasma ( ) having an of . The CP consists of
radiating and detecting tips that are each connected to separate coaxial
cables, which play the role of a transmission line with characteristic
impedance of . The plasma dimension is larger than the skin depth of the
microwaves ranging from 0 to 5 GHz, so the plasma shape is not an
important factor. The probe tip length, distance, and radius are 5.0 mm,
4.0 mm, and 0.26 mm, respectively, and the length of the coaxial cables
is 30.0 mm. The sheath covering the cutoff probe is considered as a
vacuum with a dielectric constant of and a width of 0.234 mm, which is
the same as the floating sheath width, , where is the Debye length [52].

The spectrum calculation in this simulation is as follows. A Gaussian
pulse signal including microwaves from 0 to 5 GHz enters the end of the
coaxial cable and proceeds toward the radiation tip with radiation power
. The pulse signals are reflected at the plasma–sheath interface,
absorbed inside the plasma, and transmitted through the plasma by way of
evanescent waves to the detection tip with detection power . Then, each
power in the time domain is transformed via the fast Fourier transform
method in the frequency domain as and . The spectrum can then be
calculated by .

simulation.

Figure 2 shows S21 spectra at vacuum and various pressure conditions.
Here, the vacuum condition means that there is no plasma and the CP is
immersed in a vacuum material whose dielectric constant is e0. There is
a clear resonance peak (maximum S21 value) in the vacuum spectrum near 2
GHz that results from the quarter-wavelength resonance by the coaxial
cable, which is the same as in [53]. The simple estimation that the
length of the coaxial cable is 30 mm and the quarter-wavelength of 2 GHz
is about 30 mm support this quarter-wavelength resonance. Otherwise, in
the case of plasma (<10 Torr), there is a clear cutoff peak in the S21
spectrum as marked in Figure 2, and this frequency is defined as the
cutoff frequency, fcutoff. As the pressure increases, the cutoff peak
broadens before finally disappearing above 5 Torr [47], which is known
as the pressure limitation of the CP. That is, the conventional method
measuring fcutoff can operate below several torr.

We note here that there is a specific frequency where the vacuum
spectrum and the spectra at various pressures cross each other, i.e.,
they have the same S21 value at constant electron density. This
frequency can also be seen in a similar simulation in [48]. In the
current paper, this point was defined as the crossing frequency, fcross.
The fcross frequency is clearly seen even at high pressure where fcutoff
disappears. Hence, the proposed method of measuring fcross can operate
up to several tens of torr, providing a wider dynamic range than the
fcutoff method in terms of pressure. In fact, the fcross is a direct
function of electron density and sheath width and is independent of
pressure. A detailed analysis of fcross is discussed in the next
section.

3. Experimental Demonstration and Circuit Model Analysis

3.1. Experimental Demonstration

Figure 3 shows a schematic diagram of the experimental setup. To
demonstrate the crossing frequency method, a capacitively coupled plasma
(CCP) was adopted. A 13.56 MHz power generator (RF5S, Advanced Energy
Inc., Denver, CO, USA) was applied to a powered electrode with a
diameter of 150 mm via an impedance matching box (PathFinder, Plasmart
Inc., Daejeon, Korea) which maintains a load impedance of from the rf
generator. The gap distance between the powered and grounded electrodes
was 68 mm. The CP had a length of 5.0 mm, a tip distance of 5.0 mm, and
a radius of 0.26 mm. The probe was inserted in the middle of the gap
distance and connected with a vector network analyzer (S3601B, Saluki
Technology Inc., Taipei, Taiwan) to measure the S21 spectrum. A rotary
pump (GHP-800K, KODIVAC Ltd., Gyeong buk, Korea) and a turbomolecular
pump (D-35614 Asslar, Pfeiffer Vacuum, Inc., Asslar, Germany) sustained
a high-purity vacuum. The base pressure measured by a vacuum gauge
(FullRange Gauge, Pfeiffer Vacuum, Inc, Asslar, Germany) was Torr. Ar
gas was injected into the chamber via a mass flow controller (MFC)
(TN280, SMTEK CO., Ltd., Seongnam-si, Korea), and an MFC controller
(GMC1200, ATOVAC Ltd., Yongin-si, Korea) maintained a constant gas flow
rate of 50.0 sccm. The chamber pressure with Ar gas injection was
measured by a precise vacuum gauge (Baratron 1 Torr, MKS Instruments
Inc., Andover, MA, USA), and the pressure was controlled by changing the
open and close ratio of a manual gate valve, as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3. Schematic diagram of the experimental setup in a capacitively
coupled plasma source.

It is well known that in CCP discharge, the electron density depends on
the pressure due to changes in the electron heating mechanism [54,55].
To demonstrate the proposed method, it is important to maintain the same
electron density while the chamber pressure changes the same as in the
simulation. To accomplish this, the rf power was slightly adjusted to
preserve the same in the S21 spectrum. After vanished at high pressure (
0.7 Torr), the rf power adjustment was no longer conducted. In [54,55],
one can find that the electron density is nearly constant with a
pressure above 1 Torr. Therefore, the adjustment approach in the current
work was believed to be reasonable.

Figure 4a shows the experimental spectra at vacuum and various pressure
conditions. In contrast to the simulation results, the vacuum spectrum
shows several resonance peaks that result from the chamber cavity effect
[56], as the vacuum chamber is an electrical ground that forms a cavity
structure. As shown in Figure 3, since the chamber dimension is long,
the cavity resonance frequency forms in a relatively low frequency
regime (several gigahertz). As for the plasma cases, there is a clear
cutoff peak at low pressure that broadens with increasing pressure,
showing the same trend as in the simulation results of Figure 2.

a cutoff frequency ( ) of 1.5 GHz. (b) Measured at constant over
pressure.

We note the clear in the experimental spectra. Figure 4b plots over the
chamber pressure and measurable range of . As shown in that figure, the
method is applicable below 700 mTorr, while shows a higher range. Since
the vacuum gauge used in this experiment can measure pressure up to 1
Torr, higher pressure experiments were not conducted. Nevertheless, by
combining the experimental and simulation results, the proposed method
can reasonably be said to be applicable at several torr.

It should also be noted that the cavity peaks can distort the vacuum
spectrum, which means that the vacuum spectrum does not cross even
though the spectra from plasma do. While a full discussion of this point
is beyond the scope of this paper, two solutions are briefly given as
follows. The first is to remove the cavity resonance peaks through the
time-gating method as in [57], which does not use continuous sinusoidal
signals but pulse signals and removes the detection signals that include
the cavity information in the time domain. The second approach is to
choose an alternative reference signal, such as one of the pressure
conditions shown in Figure 4a.

3.2. Circuit Model Analysis

Until now, the operation of the method has been demonstrated by
simulation and experiment. In this subsection, a circuit model analysis
is provided to elucidate the meaning of the proposed method and to
derive a relation between electron density and . The circuit model is
the same as in [48], and the same geometric parameters as in Section 2
are used in this model. Figure 5a shows spectra at vacuum and various
pressures, with the results representing that the circuit model well
reproduces as well as the vanishing of . Since the circuit model does
not include electromagnetic effects such as cavity resonance, electron
heating, etc., this analysis allows us to simply and clearly understand
the method. Via the circuit model analysis, the method seems to have no
limitation in terms of pressure. However, in practice, various causes
such as cavity resonance, rf noise, instrument limitations, etc.,
distort the spectrum and give rise to the limitation of as shown in
Section 3.1. Nevertheless, the model result implies that the method
basically has a wider application window than that of the method.

Figure 5. (a) spectra at 100 mTorr, 1 Torr, 5 Torr, 10 Torr, and vacuum
(without plasma) with an electron density of cm-3 and a fixed sheath
width of 0.234 mm. (b) Normalized crossing frequency ( ) over the sheath
width portion with antenna distance (s/d), where s and d are the sheath
width and the antenna distance, respectively.

Since the sheath width changes the plasma width, the was affected by the
sheath width. To investigate this effect, Figure 5b shows a normalized
crossing frequency, , over the sheath width portion s/d at various
electron densities, where , s and d are the plasma oscillation
frequency, sheath width, and antenna distance, respectively.

Sensors 2022, 22, 1291 8 of 11

The normalized frequency ranges from 0.7 to 1.0 over a sheath width
portion from 1% to 99%, and interestingly, is independent of the
electron density. Therefore, if s is provided, the electron density ( )
can be obtained from ( ) by measuring based on Figure 5.

The sheath width around the CP can be estimated by measuring the series
resonance frequency and the cutoff frequency in the spectrum; this is
well explained in [58]. However, as previously mentioned, disappears at
high pressure, and thus estimating s becomes a challenge. To overcome
this, one alternative way is to take the average as

(2) 

where x and g(x) are defined as s/d and , respectively, with this
equation having a standard deviation of 0.07. As a result, the averaged
crossing frequency over sheath width, , is given by

If other diagnostics to measure the sheath width are available, the best
way is to measure the sheath width and derive the electron density from
the result of Figure 5. However, if the sheath width is unknown, by
using Equation (3), the electron density can be estimated with a
theoretical discrepancy of about 10%.

4. Conclusions

This paper proposed a novel method to measure the crossing frequency ,
which is applicable for high-pressure plasma diagnostics where the
conventional method does not operate. The suggested method was
demonstrated through both a CST simulation and an experiment with CCP
discharge. Moreover, through the use of the circuit model, the relation
between and was investigated. If the sheath width can be provided, the
electron density can be estimated by measuring with the result from
Figure 5. On the other hand, if the sheath width is unknown, by using
Equation (3), the electron density can be estimated with a theoretical
discrepancy of about 10%. In conclusion, the results show that the
proposed method operates well in high pressure (several tens of torr) as
well as low pressure.
