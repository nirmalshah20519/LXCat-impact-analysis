We use a two-dimensional (2D), axialazimuthal Particle-In-Cell Monte Carlo Collisions (PIC-MCC) model to study the formation of instabilities in a direct  current (dc) magnetron discharge under conditions close to recent experiments. In spite of the simplified 2D geometry  of the model, the simulations can reproduce the main features of the experimental results. At a given position above  the cathode, corresponding to the spoke location, the simulations show large amplitude oscillations of the plasma  density and a very sharp increase of the plasma potential and electron temperature at the leading edge of the spoke, as  in time resolved probe measurements. Moreover, the simulations show that the instability evolves in time from a  gradient-drift type of instability in the linear phase, to an ionization wave in the non-linear phase, with rotation in the  + \u00d7  direction in the first phase and in the \u2212 \u00d7  direction in the second phase. The number of spokes is found  to increase with pressure, as in experiments. The mechanisms of electron heating and the role of the  \u00d7  drift in  electron heating and in the coherence and direction of spoke rotation are discussed.</p>",

The electron Larmor  radius is smaller than the characteristic dimensions of the  plasma while the ion Larmor radius is not. An external  magnetic field is placed perpendicular to the applied electric  field or to the discharge current to increase the electron  residence time in the device and allow ionization and plasma  sustainment at low pressures (in the 1-50 mtorr range) and in  relatively small devices (dimensions of a few cms). Electron  confinement is efficient only if the  \u00d7  current is closed  on itself, otherwise the confinement would be destroyed by  the Hall effect. The geometry of these devices is therefore  cylindrical, with  \u00d7  in the azimuthal direction, i.e.  axial  and  radial or the opposite. Electrons are trapped by the  magnetic field and are collisional while ions can be freely  accelerated by the electric field. In regions with large electric  fields, the electron drift velocity in the azimuthal,  \u00d7  direction, is E/B while ions are accelerated out of these  regions before they can acquire the E/B azimuthal velocity  (this is another way to say that these plasmas are partially  magnetized).</p>",

The instabilities in magnetron discharges take the form of large-scale plasma non-uniformities rotating in the azimuthal  direction and associated with rotating regions of enhanced  light emission and ionization rate.

The measurements show sharp increases of the plasma potential, electron density and plasma density when the spoke front reaches the probe, followed by a slower decay. The plasma properties present large amplitude oscillations as a function of time in the spoke region. The tail of the EEPF presents a sharp increase at the spoke front, followed by a quick decay.

The linear phase of the instability is discussed in section III.C. The spoke regime is described in more detail in section III.D. Comparisons with probe measurements are presented in section III.E while considerations about spoke velocity, electron heating, and the effect of pressure are discussed in sections III.F, G, and H respectively.</p>",

Because of the large perpendicular magnetic field and low electron mobility there is no negative glow and the electric field is large in the quasineutral plasma. The electron temperature is large, on the order of 10 eV over the whole gap, and the location of maximum ionization rate is closer to the anode than to the cathode. The plasma density gradient on the anode side of the maximum plasma density is negative, i.e. of the same sign as the electric field. This suggests that gradient drift (Simon-Hoh) types of instabilities can form in this region if the azimuthal direction is taken into account.</p>",

The triggering of the  instability is however strongly dependent on the relative  values of the characteristic length of plasma density and  magnetic field gradients. For values of the magnetic field  gradient in the anode region smaller than that used in the  conditions of<a href=\"#page-3-0\"> Figure 3, </a>the instability can be triggered by a  lower-hybrid mode destabilized by collisions and  \u00d7  flow. We checked this numerically (not described here) by  decreasing the magnetic field gradient in the anode region  (keeping the same profile in the cathode region) and found  that even in that case the instability evolves into an ionization  wave similar to that of<a href=\"#page-3-0\"> Figure 3, </a>on a long enough time scale.</p>",

In the  magnetron discharge simulations of <a href=\"#page-3-0\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#page-5-0\">Figure 5</a>, it  appears that the increase of the plasma density is the result of  the local increase of the ionization rate and to the low electric  field region behind the ionization region. In the rest of this  paper we use the word \"spoke\" in a more general sense, to  designate the ensemble formed by the ionization region  (spoke front) plus the region of large plasma density  generated behind the spoke front, and that is clearly visible in  <a href=\"#page-3-0\">Figure 3</a> after time t=10 s, and in <a href=\"#page-5-0\">Figure 5</a>. The spoke is  characterized by a large plasma density (about 2 \u00d7 10<sup>16</sup> m-3 in the conditions of<a href=\"#page-5-0\"> Figure 5)</a> and a quasi-constant potential, close to the anode potential (electrons are trapped in this low  electric field region, hence the high plasma density).</p>",

It is interesting to note that despite these identical conditions, the maximum plasma density is about ten times larger in the spoke of the 2D simulation than in the 1D simulation. Outside the spoke in the azimuthal direction, the 1D and 2D simulation results present similar values of the plasma density, and an important penetration of the axial electric field in the quasineutral plasma (compare Figure 2 and Figure 6b). The much larger plasma density and very small electric field in the spoke of the 2D simulation are due to the large ionization rate at the spoke front, which is responsible for the plasma generation behind the front. Note that despite the much larger maximum plasma density in the 2D result, the calculated total current density and the electron multiplication in the 2D simulation (respectively 4.5 A/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 150) are not much different from (and even slightly smaller than) those of the 1D simulation (respectively 5.1 A/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 170, see above).</p>",

The conditions of the measurements in the dc case (argon, 0.56 Pa, 255 V dc voltage) are close to those of the particle simulations described above. The magnetic field distribution used in the simulation (Figure 1b) is only a rough approximation of the magnetic field in the experiment, based on Figure 1 of Held et al. 15. The Langmuir probe in the experiment was placed 6 mm above the cathode surface. The azimuthal period of the simulations (8 cm) is close to the length of the azimuthal line at the probe location in the experiment.</p>",

An important difference between experiments and simulations that can be seen by comparing Figure 8 and Figure 9 is that the plasma density is about ten times smaller in the simulations. This is because the current density of electrons emitted at the cathode in the simulations has been imposed (0.03 A/m\u00b2) in order to limit the maximum plasma density to numerically tractable values. Despite this difference, the time evolution of the plasma parameters in the simulation are qualitatively similar to those of the experiment.</p>",

One possible reason for  the sharper electron temperature rise at the spoke front is the  larger plasma density (and smaller Debye length, i.e. thinner  double layer) in the experiment. The temperature after the  spoke front quickly drops to about 3 eV in the simulation  (\"C\" in the electron temperature plot of <a href=\"#page-7-1\">Figure 9)</a>, and  increases again at the trailing edge of the spoke (\"D\" in the  electron temperature plot).

The tail of  the EEPF is strongly modulated in this region. The population  of high energy electrons increases abruptly in the double layer  region and decays in the high plasma density and low field  region of the spoke. This is consistent with the heating of  electrons flowing along the double layer in the spoke front.  The residence time of electrons in the high-density plasma  behind the spoke front is long because these electrons are  trapped in this low electric field region. This explains the fast  decay of the electron temperature in the simulations and the  large population of low energy electrons in that region  (Coulomb collisions could reduce this effect).</p>",

In the cylindrical configuration as well as in the planar magnetron configuration (the present work) with uniform magnetic field, the particle simulation predicts the rotation of plasma nonuniformities in the <math display=\"inline\">+E \\times B</math> direction. These nonuniformities are relatively coherent or much more chaotic at steady state, depending on the conditions, but they are never as regular and coherent as the spoke in a magnetic field gradient described in the present work and in Refs. 38, 39. Moreover, in the simulations in a uniform magnetic field, we never found conditions where most of the ionization took place in the spoke (ionization in the cathode sheath was always dominant). For example, one can see in Figure 9 of Ref. &lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt; or in Figure 2 of Ref. &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; that ionization in the spoke is a very small fraction of the total ionization.</p>",

PIC-MCC simulations performed at a pressure of 2 Pa and applied voltage V=280 V (other conditions being the same as in Figure 3) predict the formation of two spokes in the azimuthal direction, as can be seen in Figure 12. At 2 Pa, we can expect an ionization mean free path smaller than at 0.6 Pa by a factor of about 3. This is consistent with the length of the ionization region in Figure 12 (2 Pa) compared with Figure 3 (0.6 Pa).</p>",
